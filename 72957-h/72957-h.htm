<p><i>Dear Polly</i>:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span> AM on top of a mountain
by a lake, with other mountains
towering irregularly in
all directions; a primeval
wilderness, in fact, for every
mountain is covered with a
dense forest, and we reached
our lake by an ascent up an
almost perpendicular “corduroy” road—made of
logs. Agatha and I walked most of the time, for
the way the horses stumbled and strained was appalling.
Of course poor Bertie had to stay in the
“buckboard”—a sort of box on wheels without
springs—and stand the terrible jolting; but I think
the unique experience diverted him and he would
have enjoyed it rather if it had not been for the
poor horses. I could not look at them, and lingered
some distance behind and stared into this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
wonderful forest. The Adirondacks are said to
be one of the original ranges of the earth, and
when one reflects that these spruces and maples
and hemlocks and birches had great-grandfathers
about the same time—the sensation is almost uncanny,
and I realise how over-civilised we all are.
Not that I am blasée at twenty-six. God forbid;
and I never have been so keen about anything
in my life as I am to see every rapidly succeeding
phase of this extraordinary country. It is so
new, so various, so contradictory, so vital, so
un-European.</p>

<p>But to return to the Adirondacks. By the
merest good fortune we did not have to go to an
hotel, for, in spite of the fact that we brought over
a retinue of servants, I am sure that even Quick
never would have known how to go to work to
find a house in this wilderness, and it would have
come to our taking a floor—if we could get it—of
some hotel, and having no end of bother. But
on the Oceanic we got to know rather well a Mr.
Rogers, who belongs to one of the many clubs
that own lakes and tracts in the Adirondacks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
he offered us his house or “camp”—said that his
mother and sister were going abroad this summer,
and that he could live at the Club House, which
he preferred. Of course Bertie and Agatha demurred,
as the club rules would not permit Mr.
Rogers to accept any rent; but I said at once to
take it, and gave them no peace till they consented.
I urged that we could repay Mr. Rogers’
hospitality a hundred fold in England, that we
all hated hotels and bother, and that it was of the
utmost importance to settle Bertie at once. Now
they are very grateful to me, for Bertie, poor darling,
is better already, and the house is not only
comfortable but charming. It would hold five or
six people besides the servants, and is built of big
logs, with the rough bark on, and an upper and
lower veranda connected by little flights of stairs.
Inside it is “sealed” with diagonal strips of polished
wood instead of plaster; the floors are also
of hard wood with rugs, and the furniture is mostly
cane and very picturesque and jolly. In the living-room
is a huge fireplace of stones with the
moss on, the low ceiling is crossed with heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
beams, and there are several mounted deer heads.
From the front verandas and windows we get a
fine view of the lake and the little irregularities
which form its bays, but on all other sides we
look directly into the forest. There is no clearing
to speak of about the house, and the tall spruce-trees,
pointed like church spires, and the maples
with their delicate beautiful leaves form a perfect
wall; for their branches grow to the very ground.
It is all very wild, and I am writing to you on
a table made from the lower section and part of
the roots of a tree.</p>

<p>But I must tell you of something that happened
on the journey. It interested me deeply. We
did not make the journey too comfortably. Agatha
sent all the servants but Bertie’s man, Parker,
and including our maids, to the lake three days
before ourselves, in order that our unconscionable
number of boxes might be unpacked, and the
place look as familiar to Bertie as possible. At
New York and Albany we did not miss the servants
and took for granted that wherever there
were shillings there were porters. But at a city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
with a Greek name, where we had to change cars,
we found ourselves standing on the platform in
the midst of portmanteaux, and Parker with his
hands full supporting Bertie, who was terribly
knocked up by the trip. I asked a man if there
were no porters, and he said, “nup.” I forgot to
say that poor Agatha had one of her headaches,
and for once everything devolved upon me. She
sank down upon a bench and looked as if she
never intended to move again. Parker assisted
Bertie into the waiting-room, and then went in
search of tea and rolls. I approached a policeman.
He was a big manly looking fellow, and I was
sure he would help me. He did, the dear thing.
When I asked him to tell me where I could find
a porter, he said, “No porters here, but I’ll take
your things to the parcel room. Your train won’t
be along for forty-five minutes.” At the parcel
window, when he had handed all those big portmanteaux
in and got me a cheque, I offered
him a quarter of a dollar, about the equivalent of
our shilling. He refused it so nicely. “Another
time,” he said. I apologized, saying that the act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
was mechanical, and he smiled and said, “Well,
I guess you’ll find that we can help a lady for
nothing up here.” He then pointed out the restaurant
at the end of the platform, and after I
had assisted Agatha there, and had a cup of the
most shocking tea I ever tasted, I looked him up
again; for I was so much interested in his refusal
to accept a tip that I wanted to talk to him. Agatha
had subsided beside Bertie, and would not
have cared if I had stood on my head on the platform.
I began by asking him if he would help us
on to the train, and he said emphatically that he
would, and then we talked about tipping, and
both agreed that it was a pernicious system, calculated
to destroy a man’s self-respect. He added
with a fine scorn that he did not see how a man
who thought anything of himself could take any
money but his wages, particularly from a lady.
Then he asked me if I wasn’t English, and if
my brother—or husband?—“brother, I guess,
you don’t look married”—were not consumptive.
“He looks it,” he added; “but not too far gone
for the Adirondacks to set him up.” And then we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
talked about the cheerful subject of consumption,
and he seemed quite pleased when I told him
that so far Bertie had not developed tuberculosis,
although he had had twenty-six hemorrhages in
the last two years, and was getting weaker all the
time. He told me I mustn’t worry, but give him
all the mountain air he could swallow and all the
sunshine he could “soak in.” I couldn’t make the
man out at all. He had the monumental dignity
of our policemen, but he talked to me exactly as
if I were his equal, and, as he had no thought of
taking a liberty, with no offensive familiarity. And
yet he certainly was not a gentleman working for
his living; just a plain, ordinary—well, I suppose
the word American will do as well as any other.
All the Americans I have met think a jolly lot of
themselves, and I suppose my policeman was one
of the finer flowers of the Declaration of Independence.
After he had helped us into the train he
shook hands with me and said he’d look forward
to seeing me again on my way back. “I knew you
were English the moment I set eyes on you,” he
said, “and I thought by your looks you were very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
proud, and high-and-mighty, but the minute you
spoke I seen you were just as nice as nice could
be, and I’m glad to have done what I could for
you.” As the train moved out of the station I
bowed to him and he touched his helmet with his
club like an officer saluting. Now what do <i>you</i>
make of him?</p>

<p>There’s not a soul up here yet but ourselves; so
you’ll doubtless be inflicted with another letter in
a day or two. I must go and read to Bertie. He
is swinging in a hammock on the front veranda
in the sun and <i>does</i> seem so much better. The
mornings and nights are cold, but for several
hours during the day the sun is heavenly, and one
feels so close to it up here. You, too, are a lone
figure, not on a mountain but on a moor, and
dreadfully <i>ennuyée</i>, I fear; so relieve your loneliness
after my fashion and write to me often. I
know that you have some one else to write to—alas!
that I have not—but heaven knows you must
have time for us both. What a thousand pities
Freddy could not have died a glorious death rescuing
some one from the lions when they were walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the streets of Umtali, or trying to assassinate
Mr. Kruger. I am not blood-thirsty, but we all
have to die some time, and Freddy <i>is</i> so wicked,
and has made you so unhappy, and there <i>is</i> such
a chance of happiness for you, and I do so hate to
think of you in a divorce court with all the world
reading the hateful particulars. Well, it is all on
the knees of the gods.</p>

<p>Bertie sends you his love, and I send you all of
mine you have not already.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i>,<br>
June 18th</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;WISH you were up here with me, Polly; I
am sure you would forget all your troubles. It
is such an extraordinary experience to be in
a primeval wilderness, where one never hears a
church bell, never comes suddenly upon a wayside
calvary, never passes a peasant in costume, nor a
picturesque hovel. The civilisations and the arts
that have made Europe such an inexhaustible wonder
never have ventured here. It is Nature, virgin
and ignorant, and it often gives me the most unaccountable
sensation. Perhaps when I am more familiar
with it, I shall be more successful in defining
it. I have not grasped the spirit of the place
yet. There is nothing of the frowning majestic
awesomeness of wild mountain regions that I have
read of and often imagined, and, as surely, there is
nothing of the peace of England—that peace that
must pervade any perfected civilisation just as repose
comes to the truly cultivated mind of middle
years. It is something between the two, beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
without tameness, solitude without calm, yet with
none of the feverish restlessness of the young civilisation
at its feet, primeval wildness without its
terrors; for scarcely a living thing that harms, human
or brute, but has been exterminated; noble
heights that never frown. There you have the
Adirondacks as I am able to interpret them to
you at present. They give me an intense pleasure,
that is all I can add. As we approached the mountains
on the day of our arrival I thought I should
be disappointed, the foliage looked so <i>soft</i>. From
a distance one could not define a single tree; they
are so densely limbed and leafed, their branches
grow so low, and they crowd so closely, that the
mountains looked as if covered by a thick shrubbery,
through which a path never had been cut,
and out of which not a tree projected. But after
we were in the mountains all was changed, we
drove through the very heart of the woods, thick
with high trees and full of a pleasant gloom; and
once in approaching them we passed a hill that
looked to be set close with green church spires, so
thick were the spruce among the maples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>The trees about the lake grow down to the
edge of the brown water, almost out of it, and so
densely, that in rowing past, one rarely has a
glimpse into the woods. When one does, it is to
see the great boulders that have given the lake its
name. They, too, are on the edge of the lake,
covered with moss that sometimes is green, sometimes
a mingling of the most delicate tints, pink
and green and pearl and blue. Rioting everywhere
along the edge of the lake is the wild
honeysuckle, pink and intoxicatingly fragrant.
By the Club House is an open field where they
raise hay. Just now it looks like a wild lawn full
of buttercups and daisies, almost as much of an
anomaly up here in this wilderness as these comfortable
houses and gaily painted boats.</p>

<p>And the perfumes and the silence! how can I
describe them? The fresh primitive smell of
earth that never has been turned, the sensuous
sweetness of the honeysuckle, the strong resinous
vitalising odour of the balsam tree. And the
silence just misses being oppressive. The birds
sing one at a time. I have not yet heard a duet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
much less a chorus. Once in a while, there is the
tinkle of a cow-bell, and the wind is always playing
gently with the tree-tops.</p>

<p>For a few days I greatly feared that Bertie
would hate it, but he lies for hours in the hammock,
a balsam pillow beside him, either sleeping
or listening while Agatha or I read to him. He
vows that he will shoot deer with Mr. Rogers in
September. That gives him two months and a half—I
wonder! I think I should be so happy I
should quite go off my head. But he is so young,
and only a few of our ancestors have died of consumption.
Agatha, dear old mother, is conscious-stricken,
because the disease did not attack her instead
of Bertie, and, although she never would
admit it, I think my aggressive health annoys her.
I believe that if I had rosy cheeks she would have
left me behind; but if I am white instead of pink,
I have the deep vitality that I know Bertie ought
to have. I expect he often wonders, poor darling,
why his sisters of forty and six-and-twenty should
have long superfluous lives before them, while he,
at barely eight and twenty, is stricken and miserable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Agatha says it is the will of God, but I am
afraid it was going the pace and wet feet. Agatha
frowns sternly when I suggest that it was more
Bertie’s fault than the Almighty’s, for although she
will admit that wet feet might have something to
do with it, she will not even listen to a hint of
Bertie’s well-known delinquencies, will not admit,
dear austere nun-like soul, that such things exist
in the world. She is still inexorably opposed to
your divorce, Polly; says that it is the duty of a
wife to accept her fate, etc., and when I try to explain,
she tells me I have no right to know anything
about such shocking things that do not
really exist (God save her blessed inconsistent
soul), and walks austerely out of the room.</p>

<p>But we do know things, don’t we, Polly? I
wonder if, in face of all I have been so close to, I
ever shall have the temerity to enter the undemonstratable
state of matrimony? Of course I know
of a decent number of comfortable marriages,
and—well, two—happy ones, but somehow the
others, particularly yours, stand out; to say nothing
of the fact that all the girls who married in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
our first season, eight long years ago, are flashing
pretty strong. Sometimes I feel like a widow
with a past! But how many confidences I have
listened to, and how much sympathy I have been
called upon to pour into temporarily blighted
lives! It is a blessed relief to be here in this silence
and fragrance and beauty; and when the horrors
that men and women make for themselves come
into my mind, I go out and look at the solitary
peak that towers above the long receding range
of mountains at the head of the lake. Sometimes
it is pale blue, sometimes light green; under a
rain storm it is a lurid grey. More often there are
long shadows on it, which constantly change in
form, and the highest wind never seems to ruffle
its forests. It takes the significance out of our
petty civilisation and I sometimes wish I could
live alone on it. I don’t suppose I really do, though.
Of course I have not lived yet, myself, and I
dream my dreams, and hope for better things
than I have seen. I have filled my writing-desk
with balsam and I hope a little of its healthy fragrance
may reach you.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>19th</p>

<p>To-day I had an experience which, in a way,
reminded me of my policeman. Once or twice I
had noticed about the house a stout straight
freckled-faced girl, a daughter of a villager on
an outer spur of the mountains who was pressed
into service by our invaluable Quick when the
house-maid he engaged in New York deserted
him in the earlier stages of the journey. As
I came out of the woods this morning our
rural handmaiden marched up to me with
an almost defiant air, a very high colour, and
said:</p>

<p>“I’d like to speak to a dook, ma’am, I mean
lady.”</p>

<p>“Really?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going away. It’s the first place I’ve
ever lived in where the hired girls didn’t eat
with the family, and I haven’t felt nice since I’ve
bin here. I don’t see any reason why you should
be so terrible proud if you are English; and all
the help sayin’ ‘your grace’ and ‘your ladyship,’
makes my flesh crawl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“We are not proud,” I began, but she interrupted
me passionately.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you are. You hold your head as if
the ground warn’t good enough for you to walk
on. I can’t help lookin’ at you because you’re
so beautiful with your black hair and your blue
eyes and white skin, and your nose is just lovely!
That there Lady Agatha don’t look so very
different from any other old maid that I can
see, and I’m sure she dresses wors’n anything I
<i>ever</i> seen. I don’t mind her, but <i>you</i>—<i>you</i>—make
me feel like dirt. I just stare and stare at you
and hate myself because I can’t keep from wishin’
I was you——” Here she made a struggle
to control her voice and keep down her tears. “I
went to school till a year ago,” she continued,
“and I’ve paid lots of visits to well-to-do farmers
in this county, whose daughters has had a year’s
schoolin’ in Utica, and I call them all by their
first names—so I can’t bear to feel the way you
and all these high-toned help make me feel——”</p>

<p>Here I felt so sorry for her, she was so plainly
suffering in her dumb lacerated pride, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
took her hand and patted it. “Don’t worry
about all that,” I said. “We belong to different
countries, that is all. Everything is on quite
another plan in England. I can imagine how
absurd our old-fashioned titles must seem to you
over here. You see how wise your ancestors
were to drop them. I cannot help mine, but I
can assure you that I am not proud—I never
have thought of such a thing. It is you who
are proud, and I think your pride very fine.
Why do you wish to see my brother?”</p>

<p>She was somewhat mollified by this time and
answered with a flash of anticipation in her eyes:</p>

<p>“Because I’ve read about dooks and I’d give
my eyes to speak to one. I didn’t kinder believe
there were such things outside of books
and noospapers.”</p>

<p>“Well, you shall speak to my brother,” I said.
“Come with me.” I led the way to the veranda,
not without misgivings, for I did not know what
sort of humour our invalid would be in. And he
<i>was</i> in a wax about something.</p>

<p>“Bertie,” I said, “here is a young person, native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to this beautiful wilderness, who wants to speak
to you, being under the delusion that Dukes are
quite unlike ordinary mortals.”</p>

<p>Bertie, who was muffled up in a horrid old overcoat,
with white mits on his hands, glowered over
his book.</p>

<p>“What rot!” he exclaimed. “What infernal
rot. I should think you would have more sense. I
wish you’d get me a decent novel. I hate these
American things—all analysis, epigrams, scenery
and virtue. America must be a provincial hole.
Fetch me——”</p>

<p>But I had hastened the maiden away. As she
was about to retire to the back regions, she stopped
and turned her head.</p>

<p>“Well,” she remarked, “I guess I’m as good
as he is, anyway. White mits! My land! <i>He</i> don’t
make me feel nobody, only tired.” And she looked
quite pleased as she flirted her skirts through the
doorway.</p>

<p>This letter should go by parcel post!</p>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i>,<br>
June 23d</p>

<p><i>Dearest Poll</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NONE of the Club people here yet, and if
it were not for newspapers and letters—a
man in the employ of the Club climbs this
perpendicular mountain every evening with the
post—I should cease to believe in a world which
lives in my mind as a mere clash of sound. It <i>is</i>
so quiet here! Sometimes when I am alone in my
room I throw a shawl over the clock to muffle its
ticking. It seems a cheap intrusion upon this colossal
silence. I have been in the woods for hours
at a time when not even a bird has trilled, nothing
but that soft soughing of the unsleeping wind in
the tree-tops. In the evening an occasional caw-caw
comes from the forest, a lonesome cricket shrills, a
frog croaks in the reeds.</p>

<p>I often go deep down into the forest and listen
to the faint monotonous hum of the leaves, always
a soft sound, when one gets away from the rigid
spruce, because the leaves of the maple are as
delicate in texture as they are in tint. And these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
leaves, in places, seem to fill the woods. Unless you
throw back your head you barely realise the existence
of the trees, only that gently moving lace-like
curtain of green many-pointed leaves that
meets the leafy ground. The sunlight splashes here
and there. I have found a gorge whose gloom is
eternal; in the friendlier depths the twilight is almost
green. You know how I despise all theologies
and churches and vulgar public demonstration of
what should be man’s most sacred inner life; but
when I am alone in the forest I always say my
prayers; and that occasional solitary communion
with God is surely the only true religion for intelligent
beings. I have heard of “revival meetings”
in which people “stand up and confess Christ.”
<i>Public emotions.</i> How unutterably vulgar and
cheaply sensational. And what pleasure can a religion
be that is shared with the multitude, that is
formulated, ticketed, branded with the approval of
others? I hope everybody I know, except the one
or two I love, thinks me a pagan. I am jealous of
what is more truly my own than anything else can
ever be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>But to return to my woods. I have spoken of
the sleepless wind, but occasionally it goes elsewhere,
and I have sat for hours on one of the
boulders which strew these mountains, born of
some unimaginable convulsion, modelled by unrecorded
glaciers, and waited eagerly for even a bird
to give the silence a tiny but startling shake. And
yet, as I have written you before, I think, there is
none of the peace of England here. But it is
magnificent, this feeling of lofty remoteness, of
standing just under the sky, of feeling and hearing
the silence. There is sweetness and charm
rather than grandeur in these woods, but still not
peace. Nature is much like human nature. While
her youth lasts—and how much man has to do
with the quickening of time!—she suggests turbulence
in her silences, there is something disquieting,
even forbidding, in that very sweetness
which is a careless incidental gift. Sometimes
when I am alone in the forest, a mile or more
from home, not even another “trail” but the one
I dare not leave, the ferns and dogwood brushing
my waist, that broken green curtain motionless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
against a colossal boulder, not a sound, not a
fleeting suggestion of any world beyond those ancient
trees with their young leaves, those immeasurable
depths with other mountains and other
forests beyond them, all beauty, the very idealisation
of one’s dreams of the “forest primeval,” the
isolation of mountain-tops made manifest, a fear
comes over me which I have no more been able
to define than I have yielded to. I know that
the bear is infrequent and harmless, the panther
is gone for ever, that a poisonous snake has never
been seen on the Adirondacks, that tramps are unheard
of, and that I cannot lose my way if I keep
to the trail. And as you know I am what is called
heroic, and have spent hours alone on English
moors and in English woods. Never before have
I felt the sudden terror that assails me here in
this beautiful gentle and unthinkably aged forest,
with its eternal virginal youth. Some day the
meaning of it will come to me suddenly, like the
girl’s face in the moon; you know I manage to
get to the core of most things.</p>

<p>Bertie is getting a little bored, and is restless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
but is so much better that he is very good-natured
about it. He takes a short walk with me in the
forest every day, and a row when the sun is full
on the lake. I often row him, it is so good to have
him all to myself. Agatha has been the best of
mothers to us, but after all she is <i>not</i> our mother,
and she is almost too old for a sister. We love
her, but we love each other far more, more indeed
than we ever have loved any one else, but Dad;
and sometimes when in his wretched physical
weakness Bertie drops his head on my shoulder,
and becomes as confidential with me as in his innocent
boy days, I see into a soul that has more
good in it than bad, and much strength in spite
of the sad weakness his broken confessions reveal.
I am sure now that if he recovers he will become
as useful, if not as great, a man as Dad. Ah, there
was a man! He admired Agatha from a distance,
but he kept us two so close to him that we ought
to be a thousand times better and more sensible
than we are. But he has been dead six long years,
Bertie has rank and riches, and I am beautiful.
What hope that the world would let us alone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Agatha is so happy at Bertie’s improvement
that she does not care—except on his account—whether
the lake people come up at all or not,
and, besides, she is too good to be bored. I do
not mean that sarcastically, for these people who
are constantly thinking of others never have time
to sit down and commiserate their Ego.</p>

<p>This evening I was down at the edge of the
lake watching the sunset—a blue one of many
shades, from limpid pale blue lakes to masses of
rich ultramarine, instead of the usual splendour of
red and gold—when the keeper passed me in a
boat. He paused and pointed to the end of the
lake.</p>

<p>“Fog’s goin’ up the mountain, Miss,” he said.
“Sure sign of rain; and I heard a cuckoo in the
woods to-day, another sign as never fails. I guess
them big fireplaces’ll come in handy for a day
or two.” Fortunately we have plenty to read.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that Jemima, our erstwhile
handmaiden, of whom I wrote you, and who is
now “visiting” the lake-keeper’s family, yesterday
brought me two charming offerings, a basket of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
wild strawberries from the meadow and a bunch
of half-wild half-cultivated pink roses. I simply
buried my face in the roses, their sweetness was
so poignant, so delicious, that I wanted to inhale
and absorb it all at once, and I pressed them to
every bit of my face and neck. The strawberries,
too, were so fragrant! such tiny things, but with a
most agreeable acid sweetness. I have not seen
Bertie enjoy anything so much for a long time;
and when I could no longer smell my roses—alas!
for the quick blunting of mortal sense!—I smothered
Bertie’s face in their pink fragrance and enjoyed
them again, vicariously.</p>


<p class="right">24th</p>

<p>I received your first long letter last night and I
have read it no less than four times. That proves
a good many things, does it not?—that you write
the most interesting letters in the world, that I am
interested in all that concerns you, and that I have
no other correspondent. Freddy certainly is amusing;
there is a touch of farce in every tragedy; but
I am glad you have not answered his effusions even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
sarcastically. And I am glad the days of duelling
are over. It is true that V. R. would settle the whole
question promptly, but then there would be a scandal,
which has been avoided so far, and still can
be, even with the inevitable divorce. But I know
how hard it all is on you, and fancy-free as I am
and always have been, I can well imagine that the
separation is the hardest of all.</p>

<p>I am hoping my letters cheer and interest you.
It is all so interesting to me, here in this wilderness
of the new world—I feel exactly like one of
the old colonials—that I love to write about it.</p>

<p>It has been storming for a week, cold and wind
and rain; and we have spent the time in the living-room,
about the big rock fireplace filled with
blazing logs. We are very cosy within, and have
plenty to read, and Bertie says he likes it for a
change; but I never heard such howling furious
winds. Every now and again there is a crash in the
forest and I run to the window. But that wall of
trees, with its branches to the ground, is impenetrable.
It creaks and bends and grinds, and the
beeches and maples shake wildly in the blast, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
there is no rift. But I can imagine the wild scene,
the ruin in those forest depths. What isolation!
And how like the storms that rage in our inner life
that no mortal eye ever glimpses. My woods suggest
virgin sweetness no longer. That wall of wet
angry leaves surrounding a blind furious struggle
of forces, the writhing fighting trees raging at being
assaulted by the elements, shrieking through
the forest when they are overcome, the torn surface
of the lake, all give me a feeling of delicious terror,
and I wish that I were a poet.</p>

<p>Bertie, while we were in New York, subscribed
for no less than seven newspapers, and Mr. Rogers
kindly made me out a list of the best American
novels of the past ten years, every one of which I
bought. I have read the newspapers aloud to Bertie
ever since our arrival, and during this week I
have read—to myself; Bertie does his own novel
reading,—just twenty-six works of American fiction.
After a two week’s course of the newspapers
I had come to the conclusion that the United
States was the most full-blooded nation the world
had ever known; bursting with virility and energy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
a great lusty young giant, full of good and
bad, sophisticated, but so busy as to have retained
a certain native ingenuousness; its cities presenting
the very extremes of virtue and vice; the
monotony of its Western farms varied by picturesque
desperadoes;—but I have wandered from
my simile: I was trying to say that the young
giant was an extraordinary compound of primeval
passions, with the force that those passions alone
are the mainspring of, and the sophistication
which the old world flung into his brain the day
his eyes saw the light; a little like a raging lion
with the soul of a man. In some of the newspapers
these extremes meet; in others I find either the
intense conservatism or the rampant radicalism
which are bound to be in this country of extremes;
but in even an old fogy like the Morning——<a id="FNanchor_4x" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
I find the same suggestion, doubtless because
young men write for it, although under a restraint
that has evidently never been heard of in the offices
of the Morning——.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>But the literature of the country! It would give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
one a precisely opposite impression of “Americanism.”
It is true that in England I had read three or
four American novels that seemed to me full of
blood and life, but I infer they are not literature,
for they are not on Mr. Rogers’ list (he inherited,
grew up in, one of the three or four distinguished
publishing houses of the country, so I suppose he
knows), and, judging from these twenty-six novels,
I should, had Bertie failed to subscribe for those
papers, have concluded that the United States
was in about the middle stage of anæmia, not yet
in the pernicious stage, but with blood dangerously
watered. These books, judging by the extracts
from reviews at the back, and the number of editions
quoted, have been lauded by the critics, and
well patronised by the public—the same public
which makes up the component parts of the lusty
young giant. I must say I cannot see him reading
his literature. It is superlatively well written; frequently
it has brilliancy and style and form; the
touch of both men and women is, often, almost
elusively delicate; the conversations sprightly and
epigrammatic; the sentiments most proper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
elevated; the side of life shown is almost invariably
life as it ought to be, not as it is; nobody’s
taste is offended, nobody is told anything he ought
not to know (he can learn all that every day in
the newspapers, some of which claim to have a
million readers); they are always readable and
seldom commonplace. But they never by any
chance forsake the obvious. Altogether, one feels
in the most excellent, elegant, irreproachable company,
for even in a story of the slums, or one containing,
perchance, an irregular baby, the author
keeps you close to himself and whispers it all to
you; he never lets the objectionable directly offend
your sensitive soul. I now am inclined to believe
that old story of the drawers on the piano
legs. What is the keynote of this American literature?
I have hunted for it industriously and
talked it over with Bertie. We both have come
to the conclusion that it is intended to be “aristocratic.”
That is the only way in which we can
explain the literature of this most strenuous and
vigorous of nations. High above the hurly-burly
certain of its cultivated members, gifted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
a pretty trick of words, are endeavouring to create
a rarefied atmosphere which only the elect can enter,
where those that do enter prove themselves to
be of the elect. Roast beef, roast goose, plum pudding
and burgundy, bread and butter and potatoes,
apples and Yorkshire pudding are never
served; only the entrees, the thin red and white
wines that warm gently, but never intoxicate;
champagne at rare intervals, and never, Oh, never!
in my lady’s slipper;—the most dainty and expensive
sweets, ice-creams of exceptional make,
never common vanilla or chocolate, and occasionally—I
should have put it first—a ducky little
cutlet; birds, of course, caviare, and—Oh, I had
forgotten, no <i>pie</i>. Pie is a universal taste, therefore
bourgeois, like roast beef. And Bertie and I are so
devoted to roast beef, and have formed almost a
passion for pie! Bertie says he will lie and count
the leaves on the trees before he will read another,
and even Agatha says they are unsatisfactory, and
that she prefers sermons—occasionally she reads
one aloud to us! I never have taken kindly to
this form of literature, but I really think, with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
their obsolete ideas, they have more substance,
more <i>inside</i>, than these lively, modern, educational,
elegant, but—timid novels. I wonder if that is the
word and why? I’ll ask Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p>Two or three of the newspapers, as I told you
are stately and conservative, and I notice that
their review columns have the exact tone of the
literature. I was told in New York that their
sales were small but intensely aristocratic—so
much so that a popular politician could not afford
to be seen with one—and that the sensational
papers had enormous circulations, and were by no
means ignored by “the very best people,” that
they did good by exposing the “crooked” methods
of monopolists and all sorts of abuses, and
that they wielded an immense political influence—also
that many of the creators of the nation’s
bloodless masterpieces wrote occasionally for them—for
a high consideration—and were not averse
from reaching the larger audience. It now comes
back to me, I once heard that there is an immense
sale in the United States for the sort of literature
forbidden by our County Council. Yet there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
law to suppress these plague-laden rats burrowing
in the cellars of the social structure. It seems to
me that we are more advanced, after all. We
know the world and frankly admit it. No book
frightens us if it is written by a man whose gifts
and whose experience fit him to write for people
who demand that good taste alone shall be the
line of cleavage between the real and the ideal
of life, who knows that we want truth and not
polite fibs, but the truths that lie in red roast beef
and rich warm wine, not in some nasty mess
washed down by rum—nor yet diseased livers and
absinthe. From these last, indeed, we have the
County Council to protect us, we have only
to reject the dull and the imported thin, and to
encourage frankly those who add to our knowledge
of life and mature our minds. The exceptional
man and woman sees, comes into contact
with phases of life that the average mortal never
brushes. It is, I hold, their duty to tell <i>all</i> they
know; their only lookout is to tell it for the sane
not for the erotic mind. The great writers of the
Past all have proved that, given the proper treatment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
there is no subject yet evolved on earth
that cannot be discussed. But I should say that the
great Writers of the Past had never been imported
to the United States. Perhaps they were carefully
edited and put into drawers first.</p>

<p>By the way, talking of the strange inconsistencies
of this country, I have noticed much the same
quality in the many American women who have
visited England from time to time, some of whom
I have known rather well. When they have a
lover—and they usually have as far as I am
able to judge—they appear to be so frightened
that people will find it out. They say and do the
most absurd things to throw you off the track.
Such unnecessary little explanations and subterfuges—as
if any one cared! We are almost frank
about our immoralities, carrying things off with a
high hand and contemptuously daring any one to
question us. I am not an upholder of immorality,
and, so far as I have seen, it carries little happiness
with it—neither does virtue, for that matter.
What does? Living on a mountain top and
dreaming of ideals?—and I would advise women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
generally to avoid the complications as long as
they can, above all the heartache for the man
whom no legal tie is always bringing back to
them; but I think an insolent admission of it far
preferable to hypocrisy, and not nearly so demoralising.
All the Americans I have known seemed
to me to be constantly striving for something they
had not, for a notch above. I believe that originally
it was the ideal the young republicans, in
common with their republic, strove for, but now
I think they are all ashamed of being middle-class
and trying to be aristocratic, and they fancy
that to be elegantly correct and proper is a part
of the game. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! How little
they know.</p>

<p class="right">26th</p>

<p>This morning we had a thunder-storm in the
midst of a heavy fog—a pure white one like those
we call a mist in our country, and bearing no resemblance
to the London pea-soup. The lightning
flashing through it had an odd and beautiful effect.
Later the fog rolled <i>down</i> the mountain to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
valleys of lower ranges, leaving only a light
mist on the mountains and peak opposite.
Through this the sun shone gently, and the dense
low-looking forests on those distant heights looked
as if lightly powdered. I have been down into the
forest again. It is wet, but fresher and greener than
ever, and full of sweet smells. The balsam when
wet, fills the woods with a fragrance that seems to
cry aloud of new vitality. Here and there a great
tree has fallen, carrying feebler ones with it. To-day
I discovered that the ground is covered in
many places by a running shrub, that looks like
its name, “ground pine.” And in other places, on
rocks, I found a stiff dark-green moss that looked
like a mass of tiny stars. There is so much beauty in
these woods one can make only so many discoveries
a day. This morning after the storm, I went out by
the road instead of the trail, and walked down
for a mile or more on those dreadful logs. But
that wild magnificent avenue, dropping and turning
abruptly, lured me on. Suddenly I saw straight
ahead for many miles, and at the end of that lofty
perspective was a great mountain, powdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
with mist; afterward as I stood watching it, entranced,
darkening to a deep rich blue. And between
my avenue and that far mountain, was only
another lofty valley, high above the level, far
from the quick impatient sound of cities. I had
not before so fully understood—and revelled in—our
isolation.</p>

<p>It sometimes appalls me to be so far from a
doctor or a chemist shop, but after all what the
Adirondacks cannot do for Bertie no man can,
and Agatha has a trunk full of physic. And these
<i>friendly</i> mountains make disaster and heartbreak
seem impossible. That adjective is one of their
spirit’s keynotes. The post came very late last
night and I spent the earlier morning hours reading
the newspapers to Bertie. I do not know why
Americans should be blamed for their extremes of
wealth and poverty, their proneness, indeed, to rush
to extremes of all sorts, when they have such an
example in their climate. Imagine, Polly, people
dying in New York City of the heat, while up
here, not three hundred miles away, and in the
same State, we were huddled in furs, a roaring fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
in every room. During the past nine days we have
had the thermometer at 34° and at 86°, we have
had sultry thunder-storms on one day and cold
rains on the next. To-day it has been heavy and
sullen, but yesterday was full of splendour, with an
exhilaration in the air that filled Bertie with life and
youth once more. His very cheeks seemed to fill
out, and his eyes sparkled as they used to do
when his legs would not carry him to the cricket-field
fast enough.</p>

<p>By the way, dear, Mr. Rogers came up yesterday
with several other men. (The families follow
in about a week.) They have been fishing since
early morn, regardless of the thunder-storm, but
have caught little, as the fish in these lakes have
much to eat, and grow cleverer every year. Hunter,
the lake-keeper, told me of their ill-luck, but
when I expressed sympathy he shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“They like it,” he said; “and them as does’d
set and fish all day in a wash-tub.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Rogers arrived quite early yesterday
morning, and spent nearly all of the day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
evening with us. Bertie, who improves steadily in
spite of all climatic vagaries, was delighted to see
him, and they exchanged sporting experiences for
several hours.</p>

<p>I have not described Mr. Rogers to you, I think.
He is what they call in this country a “great
publisher,” by which I infer is meant a rich and
successful one whose prestige is vastly added to
by the fact that he inherited the “great” business,
and is not self-made. A young man, an author,
who sat at our table on the Oceanic, told me that
Mr. Rogers’ firm, and three or four others, set the
standard for American literature, and that any
book with his hallmark on it would be accepted
as literature whether the public bought it or not.
He has encouraged, helped to create, as it were,
the latter-day distinctive American literature,
which Bertie and I have so rebelled against these
rainy days, and was one of the first to make
fashionable the story of locality and dialect. (I
think he ought to be hanged for that.) If you
don’t publish with one of these houses, my informant
told me, your struggle will be a long one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
But all that is not very interesting, not nearly so
much so as the man himself He is about fifty-two,
I should think, with that tall thin American
figure, which when ill-carried is so ungainly and
provincial, but very distinguished, if a little stiff,
when a man has received the proper training. His
face is the coldest I have ever seen; the eyes are
grey, the hair and slight moustache nondescript,
the features and general outlines finely cut, the
whole effect, as I said, cold, and—well, aristocratic.
I don’t think I ever used the word before I
came to this country, but it is always popping off
my pen here. It exactly describes Mr. Rogers.
He would put a prince of the blood to the blush;
refinement (another great American word), fastidiousness,
correctness, the just not self-conscious
superiority over ordinary mortals, fairly radiate
from him in so many cold steady beams. And his
voice is admirably modulated. He is a walking
protest against American provincialism, from its
various accents to that glorious principle that all
men are free and equal, which I once read in the
Declaration of Independence. (Dad thought so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
much of that, and used to say it was the highest
expression of the Ideal, put into the purest English
that ever had been contributed to the literature
of Politics.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, wherever the source of it may lie,
Mr. Rogers is charming. Perhaps it is because
while he looks as if mortal woman could not fascinate
him, he has an air of troubling himself to
entertain her. Occasionally he lets her see that her
wiles shake his armour just a trifle and that he does
not tighten it up again, but permits her glance to
penetrate in search of a heart. You don’t find a
heart—at least I speak for myself—but you find
all sorts of pleasant spots, and actually experience
a sense of flattery when he laughs heartily at one
of your sallies, or keeps his cold eyes fixed steadily
on yours as you talk, the reflection of a smile in
them. I know that he can be sarcastic and sneering,
for I overheard a bout between him and my author
acquaintance of the Oceanic; therefore, we
who are favoured should find a deep satisfaction in
basking in the smiles of this austere and fortunate
person. And he certainly can say the most charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
things and make you want to please him in
return.</p>

<p>As he went through the University of Yale and
has alluded to a great-grandfather I should know,
even if I had not been told, that he is not a “self-made
American”—a variety I am still waiting and
wanting to meet. It would be so much like the
real thing.</p>

<p>When I thought Bertie had talked enough I
took Mr. Rogers for a walk in the forest—and, by
the way, it was he who called my attention to the
ground pine. He was delightfully solicitous lest I
get my feet wet, or catch cold; and when you have
been watching over some one else for two years,
who is, also, quite the centre of all that sort of
thing, you find such solicitude rather fascinating.
Mr. Rogers is a widower, by the way, and I have
heard that American women train their husbands
excellently.</p>

<p>We talked about ferns and trees and birds for a
time, and I had the good fortune to see two beautiful
birds, one a bright corn-flower blue from tip
to tail, the other a deep orange with black wings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
But neither they nor their comrades lifted their
voices for a moment. I suppose they have sore
throats, poor things. But I did not notice the silence
particularly, as we talked all the time. I
asked him to tell me something of the people who
were coming, and he replied that they were his
intimate friends for the most part; that, indeed,
forming a club to buy the lake, that they might
all be together for six or eight weeks in summer,
had been his suggestion. He and a number of other
men come for a fortnight in the early spring to fish,
and some of the families stay on into September
for the deer, but not many, and the lake has rather
a bachelor appearance after the last of August.</p>

<p>“I’d like you to define your set,” I said, rather
bluntly. “I infer you would not condescend to belong
to the fashionable frivolous world, and—well—you
are not my idea of a Bohemian, nor yet exactly
middle-class—I mean what I imagine the
American middle-class to be.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, smiling, “we are not fashionable
in the ‘400’ meaning of the word, nor are we Bohemians,
nor yet middle-class. The set to which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
belong, if you must have all the facts—and you
have only to command me for all the facts on any
subject that I understand—embraces what might
vulgarly be called the successful brains of New
York—and those of other cities which have come
to us to stay. Mind you, I mean successful in the
right way: editors, publishers and authors, who
aim only to give the world the most fastidious
expression of the American spirit, a few artists—although,
as a rule, they herd together; but there
are several fine illustrators who class themselves
with us; also people who do not pretend to give
to the public, but who love literature, music, and
art of all sorts and prefer meeting people of brains
and refinement to associating with a class which
thinks of nothing but spending money.”</p>

<p>“In short,” I exclaimed, “you are the true
aristocracy of New York.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied unsuspiciously. “I think we
are. There was a time when to be in the fashionable
set of New York argued birth and breeding;
money was no passport in those days. But to-day
there is no other; the ‘400,’ as it is absurdly called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
has so few family trees that they could all be stored
in one linen closet; it is money, money—and—consequently—the
sort of vulgarity one most
wants to avoid.”</p>

<p>“But many of your set must have money,” I
said, determined to get to the bottom of these puzzling
distinctions; “all of these cottages must have
cost a great deal of money, particularly on top of
a mountain with corduroy roads; and the keeper
has often let fall remarks from which I have inferred
that no economy is practised by your
friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he replied with that flicker of humour
in his eyes and voice which makes him transiently
human, “there are several respectable millions
among us, but the point is, we none of us are disgustingly
rich. We are not known by our wealth,
it is not invariably mentioned coincidently with
our names, and, indeed, we stand on quite another
basis. And many of these delightful people you
will meet in a few days are only comfortably off—although
they all have enough to entertain with
in their own individual fashion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“You don’t mean that some are eccentric?” I
demanded. “Surely you would not countenance
eccentricity.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” he exclaimed, quite as emphatically
as I had expected; “no cultivated person
ever was eccentric and ‘Bohemians’ are welcome
to the monopoly of it for their vulgar advertising.
I mean that each entertains according to his—or
shall I say her?—means, and manages so to
stamp her affairs with her own individuality that
one never thinks of the amount expended.”</p>

<p>“It sounds very alluring, but a little alarming,”
I said. “Do they <i>all</i> come up here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, and many more men than women.
Our women have their delicious frivolities, I assure
you, and are always running over to Europe to replenish
their really splendid wardrobes, while others
seem never to tire of travel. But those who do
come are very representative and I want you to
like them better than those whose highest ambition
is to get into your own set in England.”</p>

<p>“I have met some charming Americans,” I replied,
“and they always seemed bright and full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
talk. It was only when they tried to be English that
I didn’t like them. Bertie adores American women,
but whether he will like this superior intellectual
variety——”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not form an erroneous impression,” he
said, hastily. “I assure you they do not in any way
resemble the poor Bostonians who have been so
severely caricatured. They have accomplished the
happy combination of intellectual activity and appreciation,
with a light worldliness and a love of
the best that their money and opportunities can
buy, which makes them unique in their country.”</p>

<p>“I infer that your set is quite exclusive, difficult
to get into.”</p>

<p>“It is—much more so than the fashionable set,
for money is far more plentiful in this country
than that peculiar combination of brains, culture,
and pecuniary success which I may say is the hallmark
of our set. I have a theory that the right sort
of gifts always is successful; by that I mean those
gifts which are distinctively American in the highest
sense—Americanism in all its wonderful distinctiveness,
but polished, refined, cultivated, purified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of dross. The exponents of it naturally are
successful with the large increasing number
throughout the country who possess the instinct
to rise higher and strive for the best; therefore,
when these exponents are gathered together anywhere,
they form a fastidious circle which excludes
inharmonious spirits, and constitutes what is now
the real aristocracy of the country. But, I can assure
you, we are perfectly normal,” he added, with his
rare delightful smile. “We dine and wine each
other, have many a game of poker, love sport,
have our boxes at the opera, and know the world
pretty thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“It sounds profoundly interesting,” I said, but
when I repeated the conversation to Bertie he
growled that it was “jolly rot.”</p>

<p>“I shall like the men if they are like Rogers,”
he added; “for he’s a jolly good sort inside that
chain-mail armour of his; but I feel sure I shall
hate the women. I’ll be bound they are rotters,
every one of them—the personification of their
self-conscious provincial literature. If they are I’ll
make a public scandal by flirting with Jemima.”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>27th</p>

<p>Curiously enough I ended my last entry with
Jemima’s name, and I have just had another
characteristic conversation with her. Last night
I awakened suddenly out of a sound sleep, my
mind alert with the idea that something had
happened to Bertie. I sprang out of bed and
opened the door. At once I heard Parker moving
about Bertie’s room—his own adjoins it and
he is devotion itself, the good soul. I was not
one minute, I can assure you, getting into a
wrapper and crossing the hall. Parker opened
the door for me, and when I saw his anxious face
I pushed him aside and hastened to the bed.
There lay Bertie white and gasping; and Polly,
when I saw that towel I thought for a moment
I should faint. He has not had a hemorrhage now
for so long that I had fallen indolently into the
belief he never would have another. I had put
those dreadful towels—which for two years were
spread all over my imagination—quite out of my
mind. What brought on this attack I cannot imagine—but
I am not going to horrify you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
details. I put my arm under his head and sat
there all night. He was not able to get up until
this afternoon and I did not leave his room.
When, however, he was in his hammock on the
veranda, with Agatha reading the <i>Times</i> to him,
I slipped away to the woods, for I wanted to
be alone.</p>

<p>I was too tired to walk far, but when I felt
quite alone I sat down on a rock in those friendly
depths and cried bitterly. The future, after this
really radiant interval, seemed doubly dark and
uncertain. How again could I ever be <i>sure</i> that
Bertie would get well? The doctor said that the
Adirondacks were the last hope, and if Bertie
wears them out——</p>

<p>Suddenly I became conscious that some one
was staring at me. I rose hastily, dabbing my
eyes, and confronted Jemima. Her mouth and
eyes were wide open.</p>

<p>“You ain’t cryin’?” she gasped. “You! Land
o’ livin’!” and then she recovered herself and
added apologetically, “I guess you didn’t hear
me comin’, these wood trails is so soft. Won’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
set down again? I wouldn’t go back with my
eyes red if I was you, because there are two or
three gentlemen to your camp and they think
you’re so beautiful I’d hate to have them see you
when you ain’t.”</p>

<p>I meekly resumed my seat and Jemima
perched herself on a log opposite. I was rather
glad of the diversion, now that my grief had
spent itself, and Jemima always amuses me.</p>

<p>“You have not gone home?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. I’m not goin’. I’m goin’ to stay
and help Mis’ Hunter. There’s an awful lot of
work here in summer, and her other hired girl’s
not very strong.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad you have found a place
to suit you. I presume you eat with Mrs. Hunter
and her family?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.” Then she added, with uncontrollable
curiosity, “What were you cryin’ for, anyway?”</p>

<p>“My brother was very ill again last night and
I am terribly anxious about him.”</p>

<p>“And do you high-toned English folks with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
titles love each other and have troubles just like
us plain folks?” she demanded.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing. “Why not?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’cause you seem just like people in
books, not like real live folks. Seems as if you
oughter just sail round with peeple waitin’ on
you and never have any every-day thoughts and
feelin’s.”</p>

<p>“I assure you we are very human,” I said drily,
“and perhaps we feel both joy and sorrow more
keenly than you do. There is every reason why
we should.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll bet you never called your parents
mommer and popper.”</p>

<p>Of course I laughed again. “No, because those
musical endearments do not happen to be customary
in my country. I do not remember calling
my mother anything, for she died when I was
two years old. But we both called my father
Dad.”</p>

<p>She gasped, “Naw, you didn’t. You never
called a dook Dad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Oh, but we did,” I exclaimed, glowing as certain
memories rose; “and when he used to come
home from long tiring sessions in the Upper
House, or Cabinet meetings—he was a very conscientious
legislator, and had held more than one
position of great responsibility—he loved to lie
down on the floor, and let us run all over him.
It was my brother’s delight to polish Dad’s boots
with his toothbrush, and I used to barber him
with my doll’s scissors. When we got too big for
all that he gave us even more of his time, every
hour he could spare; he even helped tutor us,
and he never went to the continent without us.
While we were studying he never went at all,
and during our holidays—which were usually his
own—he either took us travelling or lived in the
country with us. He adored us and we adored him.”</p>

<p>“My! Well, I don’t know as I ever seen any
farmer make such a fuss over his kids as that, but
farmers are terrible busy.”</p>

<p>“So was my father, but he knew the exact
value of everything in life, and that is the reason
he made so much of love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>This was beyond her, and she merely remarked:
“I suppose you took on terrible when he died.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ‘take on,’ but no words ever can express
my misery.”</p>

<p>“And do you have other kinds of trouble too?
Do your fellers ever go back on you? I don’t
mean <i>you</i>; I guess you ain’t in any danger of
havin’ your heart broke; but I mean other grand
ladies with titles? Do they ever get left like us
common folks.”</p>

<p>“I have known a good many to ‘get left,’” I
replied, smiling at certain reminiscences, “Human
nature is pretty much the same in all spheres—more
so, perhaps in ours, where people have so
much flung at their feet that fickleness is a natural
consequence.”</p>

<p>“I guess men is fickle everywhere. I know
several that has gone back on real nice girls just
because they seen another girl they liked better.
I’d <i>hate</i> to get left! My!”</p>

<p>“You speak for your sex,” I said. “I have
known many who looked indifferent, but I never
knew one who was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“I guess I’d try to look as if I didn’t care, but
I guess the louder I laughed the more people’d
suspicion I was all water inside. You look real
nice now. Your nose ain’t red any more; but
your eyes’s got rings under them. I don’t see
why you need to set up nights when the Dook’s
got that there gentleman, Mr. Parker, to wait on
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am his sister, you know,” I said
lightly, and then, as I was tired, rather, of Jemima,
I went back to the house. Bertie seems much
better to-night, and is now asleep. I have hung
branches of balsam all over his room. They look
so brilliantly green against the light-brown varnished
wood which defines every spike. And their
fragrance! It ought to fill Bertie’s poor lungs
with new life. I am going for a row with Mr.
Rogers to-morrow morning, and if he says anything
characteristic I’ll write it out for your benefit.
He has promised already to spend our first
autumn in Yorkshire with us, so you will be the
more interested when you meet him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>28th.</p>

<p>Our conversation was political and I must relate
it to you. But first the morning row. It was so
beautiful. It was like drifting through crystal. My
distant peak was a monstrous turquoise. The thick
woods about us showed every shade of green. The
honeysuckle is gone, but the moss is richer than
ever, and now and again one glimpses a purple
lily. In little bays there are water-lilies, and on the
miniature islands a wildness, a tangle of fern and
young trees, that is indescribable. In some places
there is a good deal of pollen on the water, but
the greater part of the lake’s surface is golden-brown
and bright. The only blot on the lovely
picture is the too frequent dead spruce. A blight
attacked them a year or two ago, and they still
look like church spires, but crumbling and gray.</p>

<p>We did not talk politics on the lake—Heaven
forbid!—we drifted from nature to art, of which
he has a delightful knowledge; but I won’t repeat
all that as he did not say anything particularly
illuminating. It was at luncheon that the subject
of politics came up; I forget exactly how, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
as I discuss our own with Bertie and
Agatha daily, and have lived in a political atmosphere
all my life, I suppose they never are far
from the surface of my mind. Daddy always took
a certain interest in American politics, so I knew
something of them before I came, and heaven
knows their newspapers would not leave one long
in ignorance.</p>

<p>Oh, I remember how the conversation began.
After expatiating upon the beauty of the lake and
the silence of these mountain-tops—positively
when we stopped talking there had not been a
sound but the gurgle of water against the boat—I
repeated what I remember writing to you about
the climate of this country setting, a bad example
to the people in the matter of extremes. Mr. Rogers
smiled quickly, and looked at me with his
steady, and—shall I write it?—<i>approving</i>—gaze.</p>

<p>“There is some food for reflection in that,” he
said. “But—how much do you know of this country?”
he added gently—I mean his voice took all
sting out of the words.</p>

<p>I told him what I have just written. I added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
that I was anxious to learn more, and that I had
been saturating myself in its press and literature.
Here Bertie grunted, and I said something hastily
about the delicious speckled trout Mr. Rogers had
sent us which we were then eating.</p>

<p>“And you found the same extremes there,” said
Mr. Rogers, quite ignoring my diversion, which I
am positive he understood. “Nevertheless, we have
a very large middle-class, and there are certain
sections of the country where the climate is very
temperate—California, for instance.”</p>

<p>“I thought that State had perpetual snow in the
north and perpetual summer in the south, and
eight months of dry weather and four months of
rain. A cousin of mine has ranched there for ten
years. Surely that bears out the national predilection
for violent or sharply drawn contrasts.”</p>

<p>“Well, you rather have me there,” he admitted
gracefully. “One gets so in the habit of saying
certain things about a country just as one goes on
commenting upon a man’s cleverness after one
ought to appreciate the fact that a little frank analysis
would prick the bubble. Florida is perpetual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
summer with an occasional blizzard; but even that
bears out your theory.”</p>

<p>“As to your middle-class,” I asked, “don’t they
all intend to be upper-class some day? Are any
of them contented to be middle-class, generation
in and generation out?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about them,” he said
carelessly, “but the American instinct certainly
is to progress. You might indeed call progress
our watch-word. That is the reason this Bryan
hue and cry won’t wash. His democracy is merely
a fancy word for plebeianism. The sixteen to one
nonsense has not received any more attention from
that faction of the press that booms Bryan than
his everlasting farmer poor man pose, and his
plain homely wife, who sweeps off the veranda
as the newspaper correspondents approach the
unpretentious mansion. Do they suppose for a
moment that any typical American wants an
unbarbered shirt-sleeved episode in the White
House, with a follower of Dolly Madison, Miss
Harriet Lane, or their own popular and irreproachable
Mrs. Cleveland, bustling about at six in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
morning dusting the White House furniture or
making gingerbread in the kitchen? Not for a
moment. It would mean retrogression, and they
know it. They have no desire to be the laughing-stock
of other countries, to have the President of
the United States ill at ease and vulgar in the
presence of Ambassadors. Just as every American
is animated by the desire to better himself, to get
ahead of his neighbours, so is he equally ambitious
for his country. I should be willing to wager
my last dollar that if Bryan did reach the White
House, with his malodorous tribe elbowing all decent
people out of it, every self-respecting man
who had voted for him would read the press reports
with a snort of disgust. Backsliding will
never work, for we have not reached the summit
of our civilisation yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of the man you’ve got in
now,” said Bertie. “He takes an imposing photograph,
but I infer that he is a sort of human mask
for Mr. Hanna.”</p>

<p>“McKinley is, as yet, the great historical puzzle
without a key,” said Mr. Rogers, evasively;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
“but we do want, now and always, a gentleman
in the White House, and with the many men in
the country of birth and breeding, education and
distinguished ability, it argues a terrible disease
in our body politic that we cannot put the right
man in the right place and keep him there.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever made the effort?” I asked
pointedly, for I had heard things. “You, and all
those who think as you do?”</p>

<p>As I had expected, he shook his head. “No.
I cannot face the filth of American politics. I
touched them once during a great reform spurt
in New York, several years ago, and I feel as if
my hands are not clean yet. I shall not offend
your ears by a description of the people by whom
we were jostled at the polls, nor what we had to
handle in attempting to push any reform measure
through.”</p>

<p>“Good gad!” exclaimed Bertie, “where would
England be if we had funked the business of reform
fifty years ago? My father took off his coat
and waded into the filth—which was a long sight
worse than yours—up to his neck. He and others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
like him made the country what it is to-day.
Upon my word, Rogers, you make me sick.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers, who is used to Bertie’s plain speech,
smiled and replied politely.</p>

<p>“Would that we had a great force like your
father, to push us into the right path. But I am
afraid the great majority of would-be reformers
feel as I do.”</p>

<p>“It’s your roast beef,” growled Bertie, scowling
at his. “It’s only about half the weight of ours
and only gives a chap half the blood he needs.”</p>

<p>“It is more delicate and easier to digest than
yours.”</p>

<p>“For American stomachs—that’s the point.”</p>

<p>“Are there no gentlemen in politics?” I asked,
hurriedly, for Bertie can be rude in a way that
Americans cannot understand.</p>

<p>“Unquestionably. There are quite a few in the
Senate, but in them the political passion is stronger
than their fastidiousness. Even the honours and the
fame they may win cannot compensate for the dirt
they are obliged to come into contact with every
week in the year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Well, all I can say is, that you haven’t the
true sporting instinct in this country,” said Bertie.
“Men of the same sort ought to stand by each
other. If a certain number of gentlemen are willing
to hold their noses and plunge in for the good
of the country it’s your duty to close up the ranks
behind them and keep the stink as far in the background
as possible.”</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Rogers blushed and looked most distressed,
for that word is tabooed in this country,
dear, and I doubt if the poor man ever heard it before.
He saw my eyes dance, and gave me a look
of such pained surprise that it was my turn to be
distressed, for it is so cruel to shatter a man’s ideals!
Bertie pursued all unconsciously:</p>

<p>“Can’t you see it from my point of view, Rogers?
Ain’t you in the habit of standing by your
friends in this country?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Duke,” replied Mr. Rogers, suavely;
he had quite recovered himself. “I think you will
find Americans as loyal as any men on earth.”</p>

<p>“Not unless they go the whole length and stand
by their own class when there is such a crying need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
for help as there is here. I suppose there’s a respectable
number of gentlemen in the country,
ain’t there?”</p>

<p>“A very large number. A highly respectable
proportion of the seventy millions. I am constrained
to make that admission, even though I
hand you another weapon.”</p>

<p>“It is a weapon, by gad. And I’d like jolly well
to understand your supineness. Perhaps you’ll
wake up all in a moment and fling off your coats
and go to work.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could think so. What we lack most,
I fancy, is a leader, for unquestionably we have
caste loyalty. But when all is said the upper-class
in this country is small—compared to the vast
sub-stratum—and the country is so huge that homogeneity
is almost impossible. So far, every man
has made his fight alone; and there <i>is</i> something
pathetic in it—come to think of it.”</p>

<p>“I think those who have made the fight must
be ripping fine men, and I’d like to meet some
of them. Will any of them come up here this
summer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Mr. Rogers shook his head. “I am sorry, but
we do not happen to have any politicians in
the club. I thought it over carefully and concluded
that it was better not, for they cannot
avoid knowing objectionable people who might
manage to get themselves invited here, too.”</p>

<p>Again, I interposed before Bertie could answer.
“What becomes of your law of progress?
If it is as inborn and inevitable—unhinderable—as
you say, why does it not sweep your class in
its current? Surely that class is increased from
year to year by ambitious recruits whose offspring
will be as cultivated as you are to-day—that
is part of your law of progress. It seems
to me that a natural instinct should force you
and your sort to labour to keep yourselves high
above the masses and fill the great public offices
of the country.”</p>

<p>As he turned to me the light in his eyes was
almost warm and I felt as if I had said something
really clever. That is his little way.</p>

<p>“That was very well reasoned,” he said, “and
your theory has certain facts to substantiate it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
inasmuch as public life does receive recruits from
the upper-class from year to year. Perhaps, some
day, under the stress of a great menace, the entire
class will throw in its weight. But just now—merely
to give the country a stiffer man than
McKinley—I am afraid they will not. We are
such optimists, our luck has had such few facers,
and just now we are so prosperous. It is only
a dream to imagine the best in both parties
suddenly deserting and uniting; for the best
men seem to avoid leadership and notoriety; it
is only by doing so that they can find a comparatively
clean path through the political muck.”</p>

<p>Bertie shrugged his shoulders and pushed back
his chair. “You look well in that tweed outfit
and those leggings, Rogers,” he said, “but you’d
look a jolly sight better in your shirt sleeves and
with mud on your boots. You and the rest of
your dilettante class are living in a Fool’s Paradise,
and when you’re choking over your first
nasty mess of Bryanism you’ll wish you’d taken
off your coat while you had a valet to assist you.
For my part I’m rather keen on Bryan getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in. I want to see a real democracy. What you’ve
got now is neither one thing nor the other. Say
what you like you have an enormously large
aristocratic class, a class which is always looking
round for somebody to snub and which
holds itself immeasurably above the masses.
You’ll be a monarchy yet with every title that
ever was heard of, and American inventions to
boot. The result of your Trust system will be
two classes—the wealthy and the helpless poor.
The hour the wealthy class feels that it is strong
enough it will make for a court and a nobility.
And a nice mess you’ll make of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Rogers, laughing, “it will be
infinitely preferable to Populism, and it certainly
will be all in the law of progress. Every American,
even the Populist, wants to be rich, and as soon
as he is rich he wants to be cultivated beyond his
original condition. After that stage democracy is
a retrogression and there is nothing to do but go
on and become an aristocrat. As you say, when
there are enough of them, monarchy is only a step
further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>And there the conversation ended.</p>

<p>I think this letter is thick enough to go—don’t
you?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Ever yours,</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Helen</span>.</p>

<p>P. S. The evening post came just after I had finished,
and brought me a welcome letter from you.
I open this for a few lines of answer. Freddy must
be <i>mad</i>. I hope to God, V. R. will keep his head.
Can’t you persuade him to go to South Africa?
As long as you have made up your mind not to
see him till all is over, I should think it would be
a positive relief to have him where you <i>can’t</i> see
him. And if there is danger—do pack him off.
Who do you suppose can be putting Freddy up
to such devilment?—that creature? She may see
revenge in it. Do be careful. If you came a
cropper now—I read your letter to Bertie and he
says he wishes you would chuck the whole thing
and come over here to us, and wait patiently for
Freddy’s several diseases to finish him. But I told
him he never had been deeply in love—and he
said he was jolly glad he hadn’t. Well, I’ll say a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
prayer for you, out in the forest—although I don’t
believe it does a bit of good to pray for any one
but yourself. My theory is that by the intense absorption,
concentration, and faith of prayer, you
put yourself into magnetic communication with
the great Divine Force pervading the Universe
and draw some of its strength into yourself. Sometimes
the strength is physical, or rather is directed
to physical ends, as when one prays a pain out;
and at others one draws strength enough to endure
and overcome anything—but not without
that intense concentration. The mere babbling of
a petition does no good. There you have the result
of my inner observations. Try it for yourself.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i>,<br>
July 2d</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE people have been here several days
now, and the lake looks very gay. When
the men are not fishing the boats are filled
with the children, ducky little things in white
pinnys and bright ribbons. I am going to have
them all over by themselves for luncheon some
day, for, so far, I like them better than their “mommers.”
The men are a well turned-out lot, but look
tired, and—anæmic. So far, I have seen little of
them, as Mr. Rogers has delayed bringing them
over to call—possibly until the mountain air has
made them feel a little more fit. New York is said
to be unbearably hot, and, you know, the rich men
in this country work as hard as the poor ones. Did
I tell you that they all dine at the Club House?
This cottage would have been impracticable for us
did not Mr. Rogers have an invalid mother who
could not leave the house—which is quite apart
from the others—for days at a time. Therefore, we
have here a complete kitchen, pantry, etc., and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
quite independent of what would be to us all a
detestable arrangement, even if Bertie were well.
He is quite fit again, by the way, and has several
times been fishing with Mr. Rogers. He has met
a number of the men and says he likes most of
them, but has taken a violent dislike to an author
that this admiring circle has made a fool of, and
longs to be well enough to kick him. He likes the
women as little as I do.</p>

<p>They have all called on us. They came singly
and in battalions. I have a general impression
of thin carefully modulated voices, fluffy well-groomed
hair, delicate features, light eyes, a discontented
expression—which is reflected in their
voices—an unbounded self-confidence, an annoying
and persistent self-consciousness, and the most
perfect gowns imaginable. In the morning they
wear the triggest serge or tweed costumes, on hot
days linen of various colours, in the afternoon they
flit about in pretty lawns, and in the evening they
are very smart indeed—several of them called
after dinner.</p>

<p>As they will doubtless flit in and out of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
letters very often I will do my poor best to introduce
several of them to you that you may see
some sort of object behind the names.</p>

<p>The four that have impressed me most so far
are Mrs. Chenoweth, the wife of a “great” editor;
Mrs. Hammond, the wife of a “great” art publisher;
Mrs. Laurence, a “wonderfully successful”
authoress, and Miss Simpson, the editor of
a “great” woman’s magazine; her name is Margaret
E. Simpson. She left a card!</p>

<p>Mrs. Chenoweth is the least objectionable of the
four, because in spite of her sleepy self-content
and air of gentle superiority, there is something
sweet and domestic about her, and occasionally her
eyes seem to fill up with sympathy; and there is a
placid note in her voice, unique in her “set.” She
talked about her husband most of the time, and
left me wondering how the universe had room
for two magazines. But if she did not show so
plainly that she was used to flattery and adulation
I’d like her rather.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond sits forward on the edge of
the chair and talks all the time. Her small expensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
dressed figure looks as if her eager
soul might burst through it at any moment, every
nerve seems to be on the jump at once; and as
for her face I followed its play of expression bewildered.
She is what is vulgarly and aptly called
a “gusher.” She gushed steadily for three quarters
of an hour about literature and art. Art is her
passion; she almost faints before a great painting,
and etching gives her thrills which she can express
in French only, so inadequate is our commonplace
language. She told me with great pride that
foreigners always took her for a French woman,
so perfect was her mastery of the language; and
when I told her it was a relief to meet an American
who was not proud of being one, she looked
embarrassed and said of course she wouldn’t really
be anything else. She then leaped into the midst of
literature, but somewhat to my surprise had little
to say about American. I was given to understand
how deeply read the ambitious active little lady
was in English, French, Russian, German, Norwegian,
Danish, Italian, and even Spanish classics,
old and new, but her only reference to those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
her own country was at the end of the homily,
when she gushed out eulogies of Mrs. Laurence,
and Mr. Henry Walker Rolfs.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laurence is quite the most brilliant
woman in America,” she assured me. “Of course
you know her novels—they sell immensely—so
full of style and brilliant pictures and illusiveness
and delicate satire and purity of thought;
but she is even more fascinating herself. I
don’t believe there is a woman living who can
say so many clever things in the course of an
hour, and she is quite a beauty, and dresses deliciously—superlatively—even
for New York. And
Mr. Rolfs! Of course you love his work—he has
the immense sales he deserves to have—such
style, such word-painting, such spiritual insight—real
interpretation of God. He is so great I involuntarily
lower my voice to speak to him, and
I think the two most wonderful sights I ever
have witnessed are Henry Walker Rolfs <i>fishing</i>
and <i>eating</i>. It seems incredible that he can do anything
just like other men. But indeed he spends
most of his time in the woods alone—thinking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
thinking, interpreting Nature and God. Oh, I
know, dear Lady Helen, you will be perfectly
delighted with all our friends, and find us <i>very</i>
different from those exaggerated Americans who
are constantly bombarding London Society with
their vulgar millions.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> different,” I thought. “I never
dreamed of anything in Heaven or on Earth like
you.”</p>

<p>Now, as it happens, Mrs. Laurence’s and Mr.
Rolfs’ books are Bertie’s and my pet abominations.
We think the former trivial, thin, and insincere to
a degree that her pretty manner in no way compensates
for, and Mr. Rolfs equally insincere and
anæmic, and laboured and dull in the bargain. His
style certainly is polished to an unusual degree,
even for an American, and he <i>engraves</i>—never
paints—quite wonderful pictures. But his characters
never come to life for a moment and there is
no atmosphere or perspective in his work—it is
flat against the canvas—like the paintings of the
Chinese. Read —— —— ——<a id="FNanchor_4a" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and —— ——<a id="FNanchor_4b" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
and see if you do not agree with me. By the way,
he is the man Bertie wants to kick.</p>

<p>I will describe Miss Simpson next, for as Mrs.
Laurence is always the last to arrive or to call on
a new-comer, I will reserve for her the <i>éclat</i> she
covets. Miss Simpson is extremely handsome, tall,
massive, with brown strong-looking hair, grey
eyes with an expression of haughty surprise—as
if lesser mortals were in the habit of taking liberties
with her—a goodish complexion, a rather thick
round profile, and a small hard mouth with a downward
bend. Success is emblazoned upon her, as
well as gratified power and ambition. She began
life, I am informed by one of her enthusiastic admirers,
as a clerk in a bank “out West,” but soon—feeling
that her education and gifts fitted her
for the higher life—“came East” and engaged in
journalism. I cannot express the pride with which—Mrs.
Chenoweth, I think it was—told me that
Miss Simpson had never brushed her skirts against
yellow journalism; although she came here quite
unknown and from that hybrid region known as
the “West,” it appears that her instincts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
aristocratic from the first. She made herself invaluable
on one of the “very best papers,” gradually
wedged her way—I fear that expression is my own—into
conservative circles, dropping such acquaintances
as were detrimental, and finally graduated
as a full-fledged editor of a woman’s magazine,
capitalised by an eccentric but appreciative
millionairess. It was only a year or so ago, however,
that she “arrived” in this upper and rarefied stratum,
and is here not as a member, but as the guest
of Mrs. Chenoweth. It must be a jolly sensation to
have striven for something so high above your
reach and finally achieved it. What contempt for
those left below, what constant self-gratulation.
Miss Simpson quite chilled me with the silent
hauteur of her manner, the level dissecting rays of
her fine eyes. She holds herself aloft, as it were, with
the rigid spine of the traditional queen; but let me
confide to you, Polly dear, she looks like a successful
business woman, <i>tout même</i>, not at all like
what I fancy she wishes to resemble. And if she
is a success as a business person I will venture to
say she is a failure as a woman. Her ambition has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
been so positive, so undeviating, so remorseless
(I have listened to six biographies of her), that
the human attributes have withered up just as unused
muscles do. I asked Bertie what he thought
of her, and he said he had more respect for a harlot,
as women had been created for two offices
only—mothers and strumpets. “If a woman fills
neither of these offices she is a failure and had
better be dead.” That is a nice primitive view and
I’d enjoy hearing it exploded in the midst of this
select camp. They exult in Miss Simpson’s virtue—it
is monumental—and has flourished like a
green bay tree in spite of New York and its mysterious
temptations. Personally, I should say her
virtue was purely a negative quality due to absence
of temptation, within and without. So far,
she is rather in this well-uniformed set than of it;
she speaks with a slight twang and expresses herself
in rather shoppy language. But she is ambitious
and determined, and no doubt will adapt
herself in time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurence! She was of those who called
after dinner. She was in full evening dress—black—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
came into the room with a rustling of skirts
I never have known equalled. I should say that
her train had at least six inner silk flounces and it
switched about on the bare floor like an angry
tiger’s tail. I think she changed her seat seven
times and always with that portentous rustling. I
noticed that this occurred whenever some one else
had spoken consecutively for five minutes. She is
a pretty woman, and the old word “elegant” exactly
expresses her; our grandmothers would have
called her “most genteel.” She has a cloud of
cendré hair, softly curled, and the pretty contrast
of baby blue eyes, although they, as well as her
red thin lips, are petulant in expression. Her features
are delicate to the vanishing point and her
figure very graceful. She is, undoubtedly, an old
hand at aristocracy, for her voice, in spite of its
fretful note, is exquisitely trained, her language
polished in the extreme, with every comma and
semicolon in its proper place; and her manner
quite that of the grande dame of the American
novel. She mentioned eighteen people of title she
had met in England—among them Milly Seton—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> 
alluded, with a fretful sigh, to her many visits
in England’s “enchanting homes.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could marry an Englishman,” she
said, with her little pout, “I have had so many
offers from my own countrymen but not one from
an Englishman—I think it is too bad! Of course
I shall marry again, I’m so feminine and I hate
work—I always am so amused when the critics
rave over my quick brilliant style and verbal felicities;
I grind out every sentence and hate the
very sight of the paper. I want to marry a rich man
who will pet me and leave me nothing to do but
to be charming and to dress exquisitely. That is
all a woman ever was made for, not to write tiresome
books that other people think clever. Of
course, I am glad I am such a success; but I’m
sure I’d a great deal rather be you. You look the
real thing, and we are all just creditable imitations.
I am sure I was English once—in a former state—I
feel so <i>at home</i> when I am in one of your old
castles, surrounded by people who are all that I
should like to be, and I am such a success with
them; I could not be more so if I were to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
manor born; I am sure I cannot understand why
some flower of nobility has not fairly flung himself
and his hereditary acres at my feet.”</p>

<p>All this before Bertie, and it reads like the most
engaging candour; but as she fairly breathes insincerity
and self-consciousness one does not believe
<i>anything</i> she says, and I think she knows it. When
she left, I asked Bertie if she was feminine enough
to suit him, and he said that she was a cat, whose
proper place was in a fancy basket in the drawing-room;
no English Tom, at least, would ever invite
her on to the roof. Bertie is coarse at times, but
nobody can deny that he is expressive.</p>

<p>Polly, are these people merely snobs? What do
you make of them? You write me, you dear thing,
that my letters are profoundly interesting to you
and that I pop the people I meet right into your
imagination. I am so glad, for they certainly interest
me. It is like living in a novel—an American
one, it is true, but fresh and new, and full of unsolved
problems to the mere outsider. They certainly
are not snobs in the old meaning of the
word, not in the least like those of their country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
who work so hard to be taken up by us, and imitate
our manners and pronunciation. No, they
are either snobs and something more, or not snobs
at all, but a different manifestation of the struggle
for the Ideal. That sounds better, at all events;
let them go at that.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers told me that they all admired
me very much, but found me rather “cold and
haughty.” I could not help laughing aloud, and
of course Mr. Rogers understands. You know
how shy and frightened of strangers I am, a failing
I never shall get over. I suppose that makes
me sit cold and rigid when, in reality, I would
give a good deal to talk as fast as they do—and
as I can when I know and like people well
enough. I did feel myself growing stiffer and
stiffer as Mrs. Hammond gushed, but that was
quite natural, it seems to me. Agatha was rather
bewildered at first by their facile and unrestrained
speech, but she likes them all, dear soul. She
takes them on their face value, and they each
gave her material to admire without looking for
it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>July 4th.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to the Club House to dinner;
Mr. Rogers rowed me over and back. The
dining-room is rather pretty, with three long
tables. Mr. Rogers sits at the head of the middle
table and I sat on his right. Mrs. Laurence was
very “brilliant.” Every time she began to speak,
and that was usually, everybody stopped talking
and leaned forward. “I would not miss a word,”
whispered my neighbour. “Her wit <i>lives</i> on the tip
of her tongue and never sleeps.” I cannot transcribe
her brilliancy, Polly dear, because it is of the quality
known as elusive, not the old-fashioned kind
that you repeat and hand down to your grand-children.
She delivered her witticisms, too, at the rate
of one every three minutes, and I should like to
know <i>who</i> could keep track of them. I wondered
if her fascinating, fretful, spoilt-darling voice has
not something to do with the belief that she is
witty and unique. For, Polly, I must admit it, she
bored me to death, and at times I felt like protesting.
But I scarcely opened my mouth; and I
don’t doubt they think I am stupid and have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
typical English lack of the sense of humour. But
I do not blame Mrs. Laurence, and do not dislike
her as much as I did, for she is merely a hot-house
product, forced into an abnormal artificial
growth by these foolish people, who must have
their lion, or the times would be out of joint.</p>

<p>The great Mr. Rolfs sat opposite me, but he
does not go in for brilliancy; to amuse, he doubtless
holds, is beneath the dignity of a great mind.
He ate his excellent dinner in a ponderous and
solemn manner, oblivious of the admiring eyes
riveted upon him when Mrs. Laurence was not
speaking; his vision introspective, as if he still
pondered the last of the Almighty’s confidences,
and, when spoken to, responding with a sweet
but absent graciousness. I wanted to throw my
ice-cream at him—only it was very good ice-cream,
made of crushed strawberries, and would
have been wasted on such a muff.</p>

<p>In the fine large cosy living-room afterward
they <i>played intellectual games</i>. My dear, I thought I
should die. I could not leave in common decency
before ten o’clock, and for a mortal hour I listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to the brilliant Mrs. Laurence exhibit the most
wonderful fertility, ingenuity, and resource, switching
her noisy tail round the polished floor till it
hissed like a harassed snake. She was in white embroidered
mousseline de soie and silk—Oh, much
and noisy silk—and she wore turquoises, and altogether
looked like an advertisement for the calling
of letters. Her rival, Mr. Rolfs, had retreated
from the field—probably to the roof—and I don’t
exaggerate when I say that the others never took
their eyes off her, with the exception of some of
the men, who went to sleep. Finally, I could
stand it no longer, and I went over and sat down
by Miss Simpson, who seemed to be as much
out of it as I was, and who, since she had
failed to catch the spirit of the thing, was endeavouring
to look superior to contemptible frivolities.</p>

<p>“A very brilliant woman,” I said, beginning
with the obvious.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s not much use disputing that
fact,” she answered with an expression which conveyed
to me that this remark was intended as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
grim humour. “And if she were not, she’s clever
enough to make people think so.”</p>

<p>“Do you admire that particular form of brilliancy?”
I asked, longing to hear her say what I
thought; but she answered emphatically:</p>

<p>“I admire success. When you strive for that
and get it you’re entitled to all the applause there
is, whether it is the brand some one else would
strike out for or not. I have succeeded in my way
and she acknowledges it and me; therefore, I take
off my hat to her. I have aimed for something
more solid; but because I prefer to spend my
money on oil paintings there is no law against
my patting the dainty water-colourist on the back.
And I do—every time. So long as a person does
not get in my way he can have a whole road to
himself and welcome.”</p>

<p>Here was genuine frankness, no doubt of that.
She prided herself upon it and was quite aware
that she was impressing me, but it was the sort of
insolent frankness that compels belief. I asked her
if she was not the author of ——<a id="FNanchor_4c" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> which I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
read recently, and she thawed perceptibly and
even gave me a very charming smile. To draw
her on I praised the novel highly—it was clever
but sketchy and betrayed no knowledge of the
world whatever—and she thanked me very pleasantly
and admitted that she hoped to make an
even greater success with her second one.</p>

<p>“I have had some very fortunate experiences
since I wrote that,” she said. “I have watched a
love affair progress right under my nose, and I
was visiting a friend of mine when her husband
was accidentally killed. She was a wonderful
psychological study in her grief!” and she set her
mouth, as if overcome by the responsibility of her
own brain.</p>

<p>“Good God!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She turned slowly and gave me a look of such
haughty inquiry that I almost wilted.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” I said meekly, “but it
seemed to me rather a shocking advantage to take.
Really—how <i>could</i> you?”</p>

<p>“Of course, as you don’t write you don’t know
that a true artist sees copy in everything, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
human nature was made to be studied, and that
when a palpitating leaf is torn out and flung into
an author’s lap he would be seven different kinds
of fool if he didn’t read it.”</p>

<p>“I can understand now why your literature is
heartless,” I retorted, “for you kill your own heart
before you write it. But, if you go in for brain-picking
to that extent, why do you so persistently
ignore the motive power of human life—sex?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said with an accent of contempt and
disgust. “<i>We</i> don’t want any of that. We leave
that to the decadent civilisations. It’s not the fashion
in this country. <i>We’re</i> healthy.”</p>

<p>“I think you are decidedly unhealthy,” I made
bold to retort—“and if you don’t take care the
water in your blood will prevent you from attaining
full growth. Well, at all events you will escape
decadency,” I added lightly. “Good night.”</p>

<p>I crossed the room toward Mr. Rogers, determined
upon retreat, but was intercepted by Mrs.
Chenoweth. She gave me so sweet a smile that I
was obliged to pause.</p>

<p>“Do sit and talk to me a moment,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
“I have been longing to see more of you. I am
glad you were so kind to Miss Simpson. I think
she is a type that should be encouraged and I am
doing all I can for her. Of course she is what is
called self-made, she has no family tree, but, as
Junot said, ‘Some of us must be ancestors’—you
remember that is quoted in the Rémusat Memoirs;
delightful reading, whether they are authentic or
not. I thought I would tell you just how Miss
Simpson stands, lest you should wonder a little at
her accent and stiffness; but she is so estimable
and capable and altogether superior—and bound
to go so far—I am sure you will think I am right
to take her up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any reason in the world why you
shouldn’t,” I replied, “and it certainly has interested
me very much to meet her. I really must go,
if you don’t mind. I am so very tired.”</p>

<p>On the way back I told Mr. Rogers of my conversation
with Miss Simpson and of my disgust.
He smiled good naturedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is only the zeal of the amateur,” he
said. “They get less shoppy every year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“But don’t they lose a good deal meanwhile?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps,” he admitted.</p>

<p>The children are making such a racket with
firecrackers I can scarcely think, but I send you
much love and sympathy.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i>,<br>
July 10th</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DO not imagine, Polly, that I have given
up my solitary ramblings in the forest. I
enjoy them more than ever; and their
<i>soundlessness</i> after the eternal babble which pervades
the lake—I am afraid I am not grateful
for all the kind attentions I receive—is simply
delicious. Leaves, green leaves everywhere, rioting
to my knees and hanging in the air. You
never notice the slender branches, only the delicate
fairy curtain they hang between the dark
stems of the trees. And the ferns, and the ground
pine, and the green stars of that moss that covers
ground and rock, and the rich velvet moss, shading
from a dark green to one that is almost white,
that covers the fallen trees, and the incomparable
solitude. Best of all I have discovered a
gorge, sloping gently on one side, the other a huge
boulder covered with moss; in the bottom of the
gorge a brook pushing its tortuous way over rocks;
and alders and ferns close to the banks. Overhead
there is a rift of sky, and the sunlight flickers about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
generously, and the woods I have come through
look so dark and impenetrable. There is a fine dry
rock with the alders meeting like an arbour above
it, and I sit there by the hour and wonder why the
forest ever made me feel over-civilised. Beside
these people I feel a pure child of Nature. They
have reached a pitch of correctness I never can
hope to attain. They never use slang, they punctuate
their sentences so beautifully, they would not
drop a final g in our careless fashion for worlds;
they pronounce all their syllables so distinctly!
Oh, this is “culture,” Polly mine. If poor dear Matthew
Arnold could only come back and live among
them! Perhaps he does in spirit and that is his
idea of Heaven. (It would be mine of Hell). And
we have so misjudged the Americans, believing
them to be crass and exaggerated. I assure you
there is nothing exaggerated about the true aristocrats
except their virtues; those are superlative,
but in all other things they aim at simple perfection
only, and from their enunciation to their
boots—they have the dearest little feet—I can tell
you, Polly, they have attained it. I feel so crude—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> 
so happy. I come out here to my brook—I
am writing to you with its baby roar and lap in
my ears—and I say all sorts of dreadful things
quite loud. I forget that I ever have sizzled in
London drawing-rooms, proud and happy in my
court and interested in nothing in life but gowns
and conquests. I forget the whole atmosphere of
flirtation and intrigue and gay recklessness and
heartbreak. I can tell you, Polly, that when you
have stood as close to death as I have done during
the last two years, with your heart-strings on the
rack and the tears never far from your eyes, you
are well prepared to retreat into the arms of Nature
and cower there. I have no desire left to return
to the world, and if Bertie can live comfortably
here I should be glad and happy to remain
for an indefinite number of years. My prince can
find me here as well as anywhere. He is not Mr.
Rogers, charming as he is. He never could stir
up my great emotions—and I have them! I wonder
if these people ever have suffered as I have,
or if they ever have loved passionately? I cannot
imagine it. They are too well-regulated, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
discontent which gently agitates them is merely
the result of living in a country where nothing is
unattainable, and, consequently, where ambition
never sleeps, even when it takes no form.</p>

<p>I have met most of the men now and like some
of them rather well. At least they talk less than the
women and do not seem to fancy themselves so
much. They are quite content to be just men and
do the sensible things every-day men usually do
without bothering about it. They say much prettier
things to one than our men do, and I like it, but
how much they mean I am not prepared to say.
They are not in the least exaggerated or silly in
their admiration, like a Frenchman or a Spaniard—will
you ever forget that experience in Madrid?—for
their common sense and their sense of humour
never fail them. And they are all clever—no
doubt of that!—but somehow their cleverness does
not annoy one as the women’s does. Perhaps it is
because they have not had time for the excessive
“culture” of the women. Mr. Hammond, for instance,
has not attempted to read everything in
every language ever written, but he can talk sensibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
about most things, particularly the affairs of
the world. Mr. Chenoweth leaves Mrs. Chenoweth
to blow his horn, and never mentions “shop;” but
he does look so dyspeptic, poor man, and he has
not Mr. Hammond’s pleasant air of repose. He
likes to play with his children, however, and I love
him for that.</p>

<p>Then there is an “author” who writes the poorest
short stories I ever read—I have only a magazine
knowledge of his work—but he belongs to
the “set.” Mr. Chenoweth is his intimate friend
and his wealth enables him to give his chosen circle
such entertainment as quite reconciles them to
the poverty of his literary dower. Still, I cannot
quite see why the public should be inflicted with
him. He is quite bright to talk to, a very agreeable
dinner companion, I fancy. I should like him
rather if he were more honest with himself—and
did not make epigrams.</p>

<p>Take them all in all they are as distinguished-looking—or
should I have said “refined?”—as
they feel it their duty to be, and quite as agreeable
as I would have them—which is more to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>There is a Mr. Nugent, a guest, at the Club
House, of Mr. Rogers, who rather interests me the
most. I think on the whole I must tell you a little
experience. He is about forty and a “brilliantly
successful” lawyer. He has argued famous cases
before the Supreme Court, amassed a fortune, and
his admirers—not this set—want him to go into
politics. He is very striking in appearance, tall,
thin, nervous, with a lean, clever, hard, mobile face,
an eye that burns and penetrates, a mouth that
looks as if it had conquered everything but his
passions, and a quick nervous grip of the hand
which suggests that what he does he does quickly
and wastes no time arguing about. Next to Mr.
Rogers Bertie likes him better than any one up
here, and I must confess he rather fascinates me.
I am wicked enough to want to see a man like
that go off his head about me. But I fancy I’d have
my hands full if he ever did let go. Mr. Rogers—he
is getting rather devoted, my dear—I always
could manage, because he would be so afraid of
making himself ridiculous that he hardly would
allow his voice to tremble unless I almost proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to him. He burst out one day: “You white
English rose!” I fear I used my eyelashes rather
wickedly, and my upper lip, for he drew a step
nearer and the colour came into his grey face. Then
I felt my eyes twinkle and he recovered himself in
a manner that would have done credit to a woman of the world
in her fourteenth flirtation; men are
usually so clumsy about these things; he smiled
quickly and added in the light tone of any man
complimenting any woman: “You are really
unique here, you know, Lady Helen. Perhaps lily
is rather your prototype in the floral world than
rose. You make my countrywomen seem like hot-house
flowers—if there were a floral heaven they
would all be beautiful orchids in the next world.”</p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Nugent. One warm evening
when he was calling on us and we were sitting
on the piazza I asked him if he intended to
go into politics. It is very difficult to make him
talk of anything consecutively, by the way, and
that makes him resemble us in one particular, at
least. There are no semi-colons in <i>his</i> conversation,
mostly dashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“I have not made up my mind, Lady Helen.
It is an alluring prospect in one way, but I should
be obliged to give up—those are wonderful
clouds.”</p>

<p>They were, Polly. Above the mountain behind
the Club House were two enormous masses of
cloud that looked like colossal blue dishes piled
to the heavens with whipped cream. They were
almost alike and you cannot imagine anything
more perfect than that cream whipped into form
by a giant hand. I thought out loud and Mr.
Nugent said hastily:</p>

<p>“Oh, call it sea foam, not cream.”</p>

<p>“But sea foam looks like yeast,” I objected. “I
don’t think you are a bit more poetical than I
am.”</p>

<p>He laughed heartily (these Americans can flatter
so with their laugh). “I am quite discomfited,”
he said, “and I can only add that I have far
more reason to be poetical than yourself.”</p>

<p>“Very neat,” said Bertie. I can imagine my beloved
brother thinking it worth while to say the
charming things these men do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Now tell me some more of your politics,” I
persisted. “Mr. Rogers thinks politics are not respectable,
but if the stables can be cleaned in one
country they can in another.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, but if I went in for cleaning, in other
words for reform—I should sacrifice a great deal.
I am lawyer for one of the greatest Trusts in the
United States, and as I could not consistently as
a reformer—in the present exaggerated state of
public opinion—remain in such a position,—that
would mean the sacrifice of a large slice of my
income.”</p>

<p>“I must say I admire your frankness, but <i>how</i>
can you be counsel for a Trust?”</p>

<p>“Why not?—so long as I have not taken a
stand.”</p>

<p>“How can an honest lawyer work for dishonest
men?”</p>

<p>“The word dishonest, dear Lady Helen, is
usually applied to Trusts by men who are not in
them. Trusts are an evolution, nothing more, a
combination effected that some may live rather
than that all shall die. I am not going into sordid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
details, but I will add that the question never
arose that did not have two sides, and that one side
is as entitled to able legal counsel as the other.
There is no reason in the world why this particular
Trust, which is open and above board, should
not have the best it can pay for, and as it has
done me the honour to select me, I in return have
given it the very best of my ability—which should
salve any conscience. I feel the same way when
defending a man against the combined prejudices
of the community. He is entitled to the best defence
he can command, and being a human being,
is as worthy of it as his more approved opponent.”</p>

<p>This was the longest speech I had ever heard
him make, and I understood it as a defence of
himself out of deference to me. So, I smiled at him
in appreciation of the compliment, but replied:</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see why you value the money
more than the public honour you might win.”</p>

<p>“Money is a very good thing, Lady Helen,
to a man with expensive tastes and a passion for
travelling. If I went into politics I should not
touch its money bags, for political money is invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
dirty; moreover, I should be obliged to
sacrifice more or less of my general practice—and
the result would be that I should be a comparatively
poor man once more.”</p>

<p>“Are you self-made?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Once more he laughed heartily, and his remarkable
eyes expressed that I might say anything
I chose.</p>

<p>“In a way, yes, in another, no. My father was
a prominent lawyer, but given to speculation in
Wall Street.—He left little or nothing—I went
into his office as soon as I left college—and although
I was helped in the beginning I have
made my own way—Ah! we are going to have
a thunder-storm. Not in our whipped cream. That
has been eaten by the gods. This cloud is full of
energy and would interfere with the most immortal
digestion. May I sit it out, or must I run?”</p>

<p>“Stay,” said Bertie quickly, “I can’t sleep in
that infernal racket. Have some Scotch whiskey?
Do you take it neat, or with soda? Nell, ring the
bell, that’s a good girl.”</p>

<p>They refreshed themselves, and then we concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to watch the storm till the rain came. The
great cloud was a long time approaching and the
thunder only a distant angry rumble. But the
lightning? It never seemed to play on the surface,
but leapt constantly from the deep caverns
of the purple cloud, flashing into relief tortuous
convolutions that looked heavy and flat when the
fire played elsewhere. Sometimes it was only that
volcanic flame, at other times the cloud seemed
torn asunder, and down the rift ran the zig-zag
thunder bolt. Now and again the forked lightning
assumed strange shapes, like the fiery skeleton
of a man’s hand or of a gigantic leaf. Sometimes
it leaped from peak to peak of that moving
mountain, then suddenly darted hissing down a
gorge as if in search of prey. What nervous
impatient terrible energy, and what a tyrannical
perversion of beauty!</p>

<p>I suddenly became aware that Mr. Nugent was
watching me instead of the storm, and as I felt
embarrassed I told him hurriedly what I had been
thinking. Bertie had gone inside, as the lightning
hurt his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“In a way that thunder cloud reminds me of
you,” I added, rather naughtily. “I don’t mean
that you are beautiful, but you seem full of that
same nervous energy and you suggest that you
might direct it rather cruelly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should strike at random,” he
replied, still with his eyes on my face. “And at
present I am in far more danger of being hit
first.”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I felt something vibrate.
Perhaps it was only the electricity in the air. At
all events, I replied as placidly as if my breath
had not shortened. “One of the rules of prize-fighting
is to strike first, and the weaker should
always keep that in mind, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Will you kindly tell me whom you consider
the weaker?”</p>

<p>“Well—the woman—naturally.”</p>

<p>“I should sleep much easier if I thought you
did not know your power.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sometimes my sex——”</p>

<p>“I am not talking of your sex but yourself.”</p>

<p>The lightning flashed just then and I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
more than his eyes. His whole face was eager
and set. I could not help going a little further.</p>

<p>“I used to fancy I had some power over men—at
least a good many seemed to love me—but
during the last two years I have got out of practice
rather. Positively I have not had the tiniest
flirtation.”</p>

<p>“No wonder you are so distractingly complete—I
am afraid your life has been a sad one these
two years,” he added hurriedly, and, actually, his
nervous peremptory voice softened. “Tell me
something of it—But—pardon me—let me lift
your shawl. The wind is coming and it will be
very strong.” He folded the shawl about me, and
at the same time I heard Agatha reading to Bertie
so I felt off duty for the present. And, Polly, I
actually talked to him as I never talked to any
but the oldest and dearest friend before. But he
drew it out of me. I could no more resist that
determined concentrated force beside me in the
dark than I could push the electric carnival
over the mountain. The man seemed magnetism
incarnate, and every time the lightning flashed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
across his face I could see that sympathy which
comes not from a soft heart but an intense personal
interest. But perhaps that interest is the
most highly prized of all by women, and whatever
the mainspring, it was sweet to me, after all
these months of terrible anxiety and suffering. I
never talk things over with Agatha; I have
avoided exchanging a glance of alarm with her;
that would be too dreadful; and until now I never
have felt sufficiently free from care to become
interested enough in any one for confidences. But—and
I am not the least bit in love with him,
Polly—I felt that I could talk to this man all
night. The thunder cloud moved down the lake,
carrying its rain with it, and I sat there for an
hour and talked to him, while Bertie slept on a
sofa just beyond the open window and Agatha
read on.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you like listening,” I said breaking
off abruptly. “I don’t believe you ever listened
so long to any one before.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true. I am not a patient man
and I am usually thinking about several things at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
once—But—I am not going to pay you any idle
compliments. I will only say that I have great
powers of realisation and that I have absolutely
understood all you have felt and suffered during
the last two years. I have felt it all so keenly that
I wish I could do something to help you. I <i>am</i>
going to be your friend,” he added in his quick
peremptory tones. “I will be your best friend in
this country which must be so strange to you.
I don’t care a hang about Rogers’ rights of priority.
He isn’t capable of understanding you as
I do.”</p>

<p>He took my hand suddenly in his warm magnetic
clasp, and I had an odd feeling that he never
intended to let it go. “This is only by way of
pledging friendship,” he said. “I am not going
to disturb you by making love to you—not yet.
I make no promises for the future. You have
roused and bewildered and enthralled me. Whether
it is love or not I don’t know. Nor do I know
what I can rouse in you. There is heaven and
madness for some man. I am sure of that—but I—well,
let all that go for the present. In the mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
time I am your friend, remember that, and Rogers
is to take a back seat.”</p>

<p>I will admit, Polly, that I lay awake a long
time that night thinking of him and reliving that
peculiar sense of being encircled with warm magnetism.
After all, I suppose that what we women
want more than anything else is sympathy and a
feeling of belonging to some one exclusively.
And when a man has the passion to stir and warm
and blind us how easily we can persuade ourselves
that we are in love. But the <i>grande passion</i>—that
is another thing. Of course you are in the throes
of that and I rather envy you. Good night.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i>,<br>
July 17th</p>

<p><i>Dear Polly</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS afternoon I went over to Mrs. Laurence’s
“camp” for tea. She wrote me the
most graceful little note with two witticisms
in it, and as I had no excuse to offer, I went.
Agatha and Bertie were also invited but A. had a
headache and B. went fishing, saying the most uncomplimentary
things about teas. Mr. Rogers and
Mr. Nugent, who went with him, attempted no
defence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurence has quite the most attractive
camp. It is exactly like a doll’s house, tiny but
perfect, with two verandas, and it is full of dainty
crétonnes and frills and bric-à-brac that no one
could have selected but herself. She writes every
morning in a doll’s study, fitted up much like a
boudoir, in blue the exact shade of her eyes; but
in the afternoon she is always rustling about, and
you hear her petulant voice and swishing skirts,
with only short intervals of relief till bed-time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>She received us in a little clearing between the
leafy maples on the right of her camp, and wore
the most fetching gown of grass green lawn with
a flopping white leghorn trimmed with green
feathers. The others were all in the most charming
white and flowered muslins and I was glad I
had put on a soft white mull myself—Henriette
has made me some charming hot weather frocks
since we came—and by chance I too have a white
leghorn, which I wore. It was trimmed with blue
flowers, and my frock with blue ribbons. I did not
look as original as Mrs. Laurence but—now I am
going to say something nasty—I can stand a
strong light and she cannot. To tell you the truth
most of these women look rather passée in the sun.
Their skins are so very thin and delicate that they
line quickly, and so many of them have grey in
their hair. However, they made a very charming
picture under the trees and I must say for them
that they appear to get on together delightfully.</p>

<p>They all greeted me with the utmost cordiality,
but Mrs. Laurence rose from behind the tea table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and offered me her cold hand with rather a forced
smile.</p>

<p>“Please forgive me, dear Lady Helen, if I am
thoroughly unamiable for a few moments,” she
pouted. “But I have been <i>so</i> annoyed.” She
swept her hand dramatically in the direction of a
newspaper which evidently had been flung into
the bushes. I recognised the New York ——.<a id="FNanchor_4d" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>“<i>That</i> has a picture of me, a large libellous photograph,
procured, heaven knows how, certainly
not from a friend! <i>Why</i> should they use my picture?
<i>Why</i> should they mention my name? What
possible interest can their readers—their million
vulgar sensational readers—take in <i>me</i>? I don’t
suppose they ever heard my name before. It <i>is</i>
hard when you have striven to belong to the aristocracy
of letters to be flung into a cowshed.”</p>

<p>I could not resist the temptation, although I
trembled at my temerity: “I read the ——<a id="FNanchor_4e" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> every
morning,” I said. “Now, had I not met you,
I should have been quite keen on seeing your
picture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“How sweet of you—but—Lady Helen—you
don’t read the ——.<a id="FNanchor_4f" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> You surely don’t take
it?”</p>

<p>I nodded, perfectly delighted at the twelve expressions
of shocked amazement. “How is a
stranger to master all your subtle distinctions at
once? It seems to me very jolly and interesting.
My brother is quite devoted to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose it will do you any actual
harm,” said Mrs. Hammond, with an anxious
expression, “but I assure you that if you were an
American you never would admit that you read
it—would not, indeed, have the least desire to
read it—and I should really rejoice if you would
reprove them by writing and withdrawing your
subscription.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t think of doing that,” I said
lightly. “My brother and I are studying your
country, and you have nothing more representative.”</p>

<p>“Representative?” Those carefully modulated
voices were quite shrill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>I was in misery and my knees were shaking,
but I determined to stand my ground.</p>

<p>“Do not you call a newspaper that a million
people read every day, representative?” I answered.
“What is it if not representative?”</p>

<p>“Of a certain class—yes,” said Mrs. Chenoweth
disgustedly. “But what a class!”</p>

<p>“A million people are not to be despised anywhere.”
I longed to ask Mrs. Laurence if she
would prohibit—if she could—the ——’s<a id="FNanchor_4g" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> million
readers from buying her books, but I didn’t
dare. I changed the subject instead by asking for
a cup of tea.</p>

<p>But that conversation was nothing to one I took
part in later.</p>

<p>I have not told you of Miss Shephard, for she
did not come up with the others. She is the editor
of a literary monthly magazine, issued by Mr.
Rogers’ publishing house. It is charmingly got
up and quite a smart readable affair, but, Bertie
and I had agreed, rather light and vague in criticism—although
very pretentious—as compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
with our literary weeklies; in fact, not to be
taken seriously as criticism at all. The half dozen
numbers Mr. Rogers sent us left no impression
on my mind whatever beyond a great many
pages of clever writing by people who fancied
their own opinions mightily. But when Mrs.
Hammond told me that Miss Shephard was expected,
she added that she was the brilliant editor
of The ——,<a id="FNanchor_4h" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and that probably no one living
had a more exact knowledge of what constituted
literature, including matter, form, style and perfect
English than Miss Shephard. I cannot say
that I was very keen to meet her, I am so tired
of perfection, but when I saw her I was rather
interested, for she does not appear to be more
than one—or two-and-thirty. When I expressed
some surprise at the position accorded her, I was
assured that she had “genius” for criticism, and
had, moreover, enjoyed the rare advantage of
being the daughter of a Harvard professor and
scholar who had been intimate with all the great
literary lights of his time. She is a tall thin girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
with dark hair, mal coiffée, thoughtful grey eyes,
a <i>very</i> refined nose and a thin ascetic mouth.
Her skin looks worn, and there is an affected—so
it strikes me—severity about her dress. But she
has a thin sweet voice, and a very nice, if too
serene, manner.</p>

<p>She did not sit near me during the tea, which
was quite lively. Mrs. Laurence was brilliant as
usual and moved about a good deal, particularly
after Mr. Rolfs “dropped in” unexpectedly and
some of his admirers showed a disposition to
hang upon the words which a large piece of cake
made even more weighty. Finally he did talk—to
make her more jealous, I think—and gave
them quite a lecture on celestial botany, as it were.
Mrs. Laurence could only get the better of him
by capping his melodious paragraphs with scintillating
epigrams, which annoyed him excessively.
I sincerely wish they would murder each other.
Finally I became so bored that I wandered down
to the edge of the lake, and in a moment Miss
Shephard joined me.</p>

<p>“Like all great writers,” she said apologetically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
“he puts his best in his books, and sometimes
lacks magnetism and fresh thought in talking.”</p>

<p>For some reason Miss S. antagonises me. Perhaps
it is a certain air of omniscience, the result
of being a factor in the destinies of so many great
and brilliant authors. So I answered with some
pleasure:</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Rolfs’ books as dull as his speech.
He has his points, but he is not a <i>born</i> author,
therefore you see the little glittering implements
and smell the oil all the time, and of course his
stories do not <i>go</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is some truth in what you say,” she answered
sweetly, “but then don’t you think that a
man with so great and beautiful a mind should
be above being a good story-teller?”</p>

<p>“Shakespeare was not.”</p>

<p>“True, dear Lady Helen, but I need not remind
you that we are in neither the times nor the
country of Shakespeare. Have you observed how
non-imitative, how independent we are? There
was a time, of course, when American writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
slavishly imitated, and in consequence burlesqued,
English literature; the only exceptions were
Hawthorne and Poe, and, later, Mark Twain and
Bret Harte; but the literature of the last twenty
years, which includes so many illustrious names—surely
there never has been anything like it in
the world.”</p>

<p>“There never has! I suppose I am old-fashioned
but it wearies and irritates me—I do not
wish to be rude—but—really—I like to read about
men and women with human passions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a discussion without frankness is a poor
affair. I am sure that yours is merely a first impression
and that our literature will fascinate you
in time. Will you permit me a brief explanation?
It is our object to produce a literature which shall
demonstrate in what ways we are different from
all other nations—those differences, peculiarities
and so forth which our new and in all things
unique country has evolved. Why should we
demonstrate—and encourage—the worn out passions
that are common to all countries? The refined
of ours prefer to forget that such things exist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
All well-brought up American girls are taught
to ignore this lamentable side of human nature,
and never voluntarily to think of it. Without
boasting I think I can say that this is the most
<i>refined</i> country the world has ever known, and
that our literature proves it.”</p>

<p>“But occasionally you develop an author of irrepressible
virility who gives the world to understand
that a certain percentage at least of the
United States are very much like the old accepted
idea of human nature.”</p>

<p>“They do not count,” she said emphatically,
“because we will not admit them to the ranks of
literature, and they <i>must</i> go to the wall in time.
The literary pages of the high-class newspapers,
and the weekly and monthly bulletins never paragraph
them, never refer to them, except in the
reviews which advertising exigencies compel.
Then we kill them by sneers, not abuse—which
always excites a lamentable current in human
nature. They are quietly brushed aside, and the
real jewels of American literature forced into
even greater prominence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Suppose one of these outsiders equals the
elect in literary quality?”</p>

<p>“He cannot, because matter and manner are
really one. They are too <i>strong</i>, too bold and unpleasant,
therefore they shatter and deface that
fine exquisite thing called style.”</p>

<p>“Your style. Cannot you conceive the possibility
of any other standard being as correct?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It is a subject to which we
have given years of earnest and analytical
thought.”</p>

<p>“What of the very different standards of England,
France, Germany, Russia? The novels of
all countries seem to be issued by your American
firms—and, presumably, read.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we are quite willing that each country
should have its own standard. Those old states,
indeed, could not imitate us, for they have not
the same material. Therefore when a successful
European novel treats of things that no well-bred
American will discuss, we are generous enough
not to be hyper-critical of a race which differs from
us in every particular. The older nations are naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
coarse, and allowance should be made for
them. But there is not one of our elected authors
who would dare or care to treat a subject in the
same way. And why <i>should</i> he deal with nasty
passion? He has the brilliant kaleidoscopic surface
of American life to treat.”</p>

<p>“And you cannot conceive of a day when the
standard will change?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“The minority of one generation is usually the
majority of the next,” I said, now warmed to the
theme. “Your people of the world—and I know
that you have that class—have chosen as their favourites
the very authors you have tabooed, and
whose works do not reach, I am told, the great
public you instruct. As these few authors set their
faces against emasculation they offend your aristocratic
middle-class, and as they are not erotic your
unspeakable sub-stratum will have none of them;
but they deal truthfully with that world which
those of your country who have enjoyed superior
advantages can stand reading about.”</p>

<p>I had hit her at last. She coloured and drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
herself up. “I do not understand your term ‘aristocratic
middle-class,’” she said icily. “And I can
only assert definitely that we who give our brains
and time and culture to the subject are setting and
maintaining a standard that always will prevail.”</p>

<p>I turned to go and say good-bye to Mrs. Laurence,
but I could not forbear a parting shot. I
waved my hand at the company.</p>

<p>“I wonder they marry,” I said. “And I think
it positively indecent of them to have children.”</p>


<p class="right">20th July</p>

<p>I am very much alone these days. Bertie is so
much better that he spends the entire day fishing
or at the Club House, and frequently dines and
spends the evening there as well. Agatha has discovered
at least twenty neglected correspondents
and writes as hard as Mrs. Laurence or Mr. Rolfs,
all the morning. I do not mind that, for it keeps
her in the house and I can receive any of the
men who care to call; but <i>every</i> afternoon, Polly,
she goes to Mrs. Chenoweth’s and plays whist,
and I either have to shut myself up like a nun or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
walk in the wood alone. Of course I could defy
the dear old soul, but that would be the end of
an ideal domestic harmony, and as for Bertie he
would be furious. Mr. Rogers is the only person
privileged to walk alone with me, and I do not
know whether he is flattered or not. I had heard
a good deal about the liberty of American girls,
but Mrs. Chenoweth assures me that that is all a
mistake as far as the upper classes are concerned.
Still, I have had a good many conversations with
Mr. Nugent, and some day perhaps I’ll relate
them to you. He calls in the evening and we
wander off the veranda to the edge of the lake
and stand there for an hour or so admiring the
sunset, and once or twice we have met quite
accidentally in the forest. After all, I do not own
the trail down the mountain even if it is my
favourite one. He certainly is interesting, Polly,
although in so different a way from all the men I
have ever known or read about that I really do
not know whether I like him or not. He fascinates
me, but that is his magnetism, the concentration
of his preternaturally clever mind upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
myself, the brilliant and unexpected things he
says, and the truly delightful little attentions he
pays me, when I know that he is full of restlessness
and hardness, and ambition and nervous contempt
of the details of life. But the moment he
comes near me I feel protected and surrounded;
I am possessed immediately to drop my shawl or
handkerchief or worry about the punkies—dreadful
little beasts that he keeps off very effectively
with a fan or his hat. Once I made him go down
on his knees and tie my shoe, merely because I
wanted him to see that my foot was as small as
any of his countrywomen’s, in spite of my five ft.
seven, and much better shod. On another day I
had a headache, and instead of remaining in bed
I had Henriette arrange me luxuriously on a
divan in the living-room, and received him when
he called. I had an uncontrollable desire to see
how he would act when I was ill. He was charming,
in an abrupt, sincere, and wholly tactless way.
I think if I had known others like him or had
known him about five years I should almost fall
in love with him; but how we cling to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
ideals! Independence of thought! We are all
creatures of traditions.</p>

<p>I may just as well tell you first as last, Polly,
that I am sure both Mr. Rogers and Mr. Nugent
have made up their minds to marry me. Agatha
is blind and Bertie amused, for he cannot imagine
me falling in love with anything un-English and
new. You see, I <i>look</i> so—well, traditional, few
know or suspect that I am impetuous and full of
curiosity and love of novelty <i>inside</i>. Of course,
as I said, I am in a way as traditional as I look,
but in another I’m not. I don’t know if I have
expressed myself clearly.</p>

<p>I am sure that Mr. Rogers and all of them think
that he has the better chance, because he is so cold
and calm and correct. He really is charming in his
way and I think I might have had rather a jolly
little flirtation with him if Mr. Nugent had not
happened to be a guest of the Club. But <i>he</i> talks
to me about things that interest me so much more,
and he has made me talk to him about myself as I
never talked before—even to you. If I could remember
all of the nonsense we have talked I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
write it to you, but you know I never did have
any memory.</p>

<p>The other day a year-old doe mysteriously appeared
in our ice-house with my name printed on
a card lying on its chest. I <i>know</i> that either Mr. R.
or Mr. N. shot it for me, but I do not dare thank
one or the other or even hint the subject: the
game laws are so severe that it would be like a
breach of confidence. But it has made all other
meat insipid and we enjoyed it quite enough to
compensate the offender for the risk he ran. It
was one evening when both were calling that I
regretted being obliged to wait till September for
the game I like best.</p>

<p>Mr. N’s first name is Luke.</p>

<p class="right">22nd July</p>

<p>Well, I will tell you of one conversation at
least between Mr. Nugent and myself. A very
celebrated—you may be sure he is in the superlative
class—lung specialist came up the other day
to visit the Chenoweths. Although Bertie is apparently
so much better, the moment this doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
appeared I felt that I must have a verdict. At first
I thought of appealing to Mr. Rogers, but finally
concluded that as I had talked so much to Mr.
Nugent it would be positively unkind to pass him
over; besides it is so much easier to speak to him
about <i>anything</i>. The <i>one</i> thing that keeps me from
feeling the <i>perfect</i> freedom of friendship when I
am alone with him is the fear that he suddenly will
lose his head and take me in his arms and kiss
me. He looks passion incarnate and I know that
if he ever did let go he would be like one of these
alarming electrical storms that visit us every two
or three days. However, I have managed him
rather well, so far.</p>

<p>Well, I confided in him, and he engaged to
persuade Dr. Soulé and Bertie to meet for examination,
and pledged himself to get the truth out
of the doctor and tell me every word of it. It was
finally agreed—Bertie was a long time being persuaded—that
they were to meet this morning in
Mr. Nugent’s room and that at four this afternoon
Mr. N. and I would meet at a certain spot in the
forest, where I should hear the fateful truth—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
thought the appointment was justifiable in the circumstances.</p>

<p>By three I was so nervous that I could not stay
in the house and I plunged into the forest, praying
that I would meet no one else. Fortunately
our camp is alone on our side of the lake and the
others prefer the trails behind the Club House
and at the north end. I walked far down the
mountain to quiet my nerves a little, then returned
to the place where we had agreed to meet.
It was the rocky brook I told you of, but some
distance below the boulder. The opposite bank
sloped up gently, its gloom hung with scattered
leaves and sun-flecks. I sat down on a rock among
the alders, still nervous, my hand, indeed, pressed
against my heart, but—what strange tricks the
mind plays us—my terrible anxiety crossed by
imaginings of what Mr. N. would do and say
should he bring me the worst. In a moment, too,
my mind was diverted by the dearest sight. A
chipmunk—a tiny thing no longer than my finger
with a snow white breast and reddish brown back
striped with grey and ivory—sat on his hind legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
on a stone opposite me eating a nut which he
held in his front paws. His black restless eyes
never left my face as he tore that nut apart with
teeth and nail, and he seemed to have made up
his little mind that I was quite stationary—he did
seem to enjoy that nut so much. His bushy tail
stood straight up behind and curled back from
his head. It was quite an inch longer than himself,
and not a bit of him moved but those tight
little arms and those crunching teeth. He ate the
entire nut, and when he had finished and dropped
the shell, he still sat there on his hind legs, glancing
about, his eyes never wandering far from my
face, and absorbing my attention so completely
that I quite forgot the apprehension that had torn
me for the past four hours. But our mutual interest
was shattered by a footstep. I sprang to my
feet and he scampered into the ferns.</p>

<p>The moment I saw Mr. N.’s face I knew that
I was not to hear the worst, at all events; and
then, for the life of me, I could not let the subject
be broached. I hurriedly commenced to tell him
about the chipmunk and he sat down on the stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
it had deserted and listened as if he never had
heard of a chipmunk before.</p>

<p>“I’ll try and get you one,” he said. “I think
one might be tamed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should love it!” I exclaimed. “It would
be company for hours at a time. I am sure it has
intelligence.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have many lonely hours,” he
said. “I think you do not like our people here.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “they fidget me. I really admire
them and I never in all my life believed that so
many clever people could be got together in one
place. But—that is it—they are not my own sort.”</p>

<p>“No, they are not, and I have a plan to propose
to you, that I think might be carried out now
that your brother is so much better. I have a number
of friends at another lake about ten miles from
here. They are very different from these—far more
like what you have been used to. They belong to
one of the worldly sets in New York, and, while
they are quite as clever as our friends here, cleverness
is not their métier and they are not so self-conscious
about it. They bought Chipmunk Lake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and built cottages there that they might go into
camp whenever they felt that they needed rest
more than Europe or Newport—Should you like
to visit there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how?”</p>

<p>“I should have said that my married sister is
there and that I have written to her about you.
She would be delighted if you would pay her a
visit. Of course Lady Agatha will go with you,
and the Duke can transfer himself to the Club
House for a time.”</p>

<p>“He is there always, anyhow,” I said, and I
suspect I pouted. At all events he smiled sympathetically
and said,</p>

<p>“I am afraid you have learned already something
of the selfishness and ingratitude of man.”</p>

<p>“It is a good preparation for matrimony,” I
remarked drily.</p>

<p>“Are you contemplating matrimony?” It is
interesting rather to bring some colour into the
face of an American.</p>

<p>“I am always afraid I might marry some time
when I am unusually bored.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“It is not so great a risk to bore you, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean by Circumstances. I should expect
the man to descend suddenly into them with
the wings of an archangel and bear me off.”</p>

<p>“Are you very much bored here? Have I come
too soon?”</p>

<p>“I never have enjoyed myself so much.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless you are not averse to a change.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as my time is short in the United States
and as human nature is the most interesting study
in the world, I want to meet as many of your interesting
types as possible.”</p>

<p>“Your stay may be longer than you think. Soulé
says that the Duke must not think of leaving the
Adirondacks for two years.”</p>

<p>He had me at last. “Two years!” I gasped.
“Must we stay up here for two years?” The place
has lost some of its charm since these people came.</p>

<p>“Not here, for you would be snowed in in winter
and uncomfortable in every way. I have suggested
to the Duke that he endeavour at once to
lease a house at Lake Placid. There you would
be close to an express train to New York—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
you could visit frequently—and undoubtedly
could find a house with golf links, tennis court, etc.,
to say nothing of good trails where you could
have daily rides. I know you are longing to be
on a horse again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am! How did you guess it? That does
not sound so hopeless. I suppose our friends would
visit us occasionally.”</p>

<p>“I can assert positively that some of them would
come as often as they were asked.”</p>

<p>“It would be charity, of course. How kind you
and Mr. Rogers have been to think of everything
for us.”</p>

<p>Again I had managed to bring the colour into
his face. “Rogers is a kind fatherly soul,” he said,
tartly. “I don’t pretend to be philanthropic.”</p>

<p>Here I was afraid he would propose to me so I
said hurriedly:</p>

<p>“We have forgotten all about Chipmunk Lake.
I should like to see some other lakes and some
other people. But it is a great deal to ask of
your sister.”</p>

<p>“My sister is undoubtedly pining for a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
acquaintance. There are only four families at the
lake and they soon get talked out. Will you
go? I may as well confess that I have already
written to and heard from her. Here is her note
to you.”</p>

<p>It was such a jolly letter, so direct and natural
and unwitty. I felt at home with her at once—her
name is Mrs. Van Worden, and I liked her
further because she spelt Van with a capital V.
I am told that Van in New York is quite an
insignia of nobility and I met two of its proud
possessors in London who had it printed on their
cards with a small v. Considering that it is over
every other shop in Holland and Belgium, this
certainly is an instance of American progressiveness.</p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Nugent—who is delightfully
free of all nonsense, bless him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do want to go,” I said, “and I hope
it can be arranged—if only for the pleasure of
meeting Mrs. Van Worden. I <i>feel</i> I shall get
on with her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will get on, I am sure. She and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
her friends at the lake belong to the great world
without going in for <i>all</i> its frivolities and vulgarities.
Let us go back and arrange it at once,”
he said, jumping up. “There is no reason why
we should not go to-morrow.”</p>


<p class="right">24th</p>

<p>But we did not go “to-morrow,” Polly, and I
have not been really hopeful of going until to-night.
Agatha said quietly and impassively that,
better or not, nothing would induce her to leave
Bertie, that she would never sleep three yards
away from him until he was quite well again.
That left me without a chaperon, for although
Mrs. Van Worden had written her a charming
note too, she had not invited any one else at the
lake, and I believe she knows several of them.
Whether this omission rankled—she appears to
be quite a personage—or whether they are all
determined I shall marry Mr. Rogers, I don’t
know, but I was invited to the Club House to
luncheon next day and not less than four women
attempted to dissuade me from going. The road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
was “frightful,” quite the worst in the Adirondacks.
Life there was unbearably dull. They were
worked out society women who took a sort of
rest cure in the Adirondacks, eating and sleeping
themselves into a condition of recuperating stupidity.
There were “no men,” as the fishing
was not good, and too many other drawbacks to
mention. It was Mrs. Hammond who was commissioned
with the final dissuasions. She walked
home with me, and as we were crossing the
pretty rustic bridge over the lake’s outlet, she
put her hand in my arm, and said with a slight
blush:</p>

<p>“You must not mind what I am going to say
to you, dear Lady Helen, I take such an interest
in you. Who could help it?—you are so beautiful
and a stranger here. And of course I am
nearly ten years older than yourself and a married
woman. I <i>don’t</i> want you to go to those people;
they are all rather fast. Mrs. Van Worden has had
several stories in circulation about her that have
come very close to being scandals——.”</p>

<p>“What!” I cried, “am I really to meet an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
American woman who has committed adultery?
How much at home I shall feel! So many of my
friends have, you know.”</p>

<p>“Lady Helen!” Never shall I forget that gasping
shriek nor that poor scandalized little face.
I almost relented.</p>

<p>“If she will only admit it,” I pursued gloomily,
“but they scarcely ever will. I do know one
American woman who told me the second time I
met her that she had a lover, but she had lived in
England fifteen years and cut all her American
acquaintances. I cannot understand your reticence.”</p>

<p>“Lady Helen! Do you mean to insinuate that
any of us——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, no. You are all shockingly virtuous
here.”</p>

<p>She stared at me for a moment longer, then
curiosity got the better of her horror. She did not
replace her hand within my arm, but she resumed
her walk to my camp, evidently determined to
understand me.</p>

<p>“Let us have this out, Lady Helen, I implore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
you?” she said. “Do I understand that you
countenance immorality?”</p>

<p>“I accept the inevitable. It does not appeal to
me personally, but if it does to other women and
helps them to dissipate the ennui of life, that is
none of my affair.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is the result of having every good
thing in life flung at your feet, of living an idle
life of fashion that has no excitement left in it
but intrigue.”</p>

<p>“Our lowest class is much worse than our
highest, and quite open and unembarrassed about
it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot account for it!” The poor little
woman’s voice was tragic.</p>

<p>“Why try to account for everything? Facts
are facts, that is enough.”</p>

<p>“I never have really believed one tenth of the
scandals of fashionable life I have heard—I
have trained myself to wait for divorce-court
proof——”</p>

<p>“You have tried to dissuade me from visiting
Mrs. Van Worden because she is suspected of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
having loved more frequently than she has married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that does not mean that I <i>believe</i> it.
I simply do not want you to be identified with
a woman who has been talked about. She certainly
cannot contaminate you if you hold such
extraordinary views. But <i>do</i> you, dear Lady
Helen?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said impatiently. “Don’t you? Do
you pretend to ignore the fact that hundreds of
thousands of women have lovers.”</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> not admit it.”</p>

<p>“But you know it if you know anything at
all. Like your literature you blink it, as you blink
every other fact connected with real life.”</p>

<p>Again she stopped and stared at me. “You
look the incarnation of maiden purity,” she exclaimed,
“a tall white royal English lily, as Mr.
Rogers calls you. It seems incredible that you can
have such a perverted mind. You remind me of
that dreadful heroine of Mallock’s——”</p>

<p>“I have not a perverted mind,” I exclaimed
angrily, for she really was too silly, “and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
have nothing in common with that filthy creature——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she interrupted hurriedly,
“no one on earth would ever accuse <i>you</i> of being
less stainless—really—than you look—I mean
your mind—your knowledge——Oh,” she continued
desperately, “I can’t make you out. I have
heard of the insolent frankness of the English aristocracy—that
you hold yourself above all laws—the
Duke is terrifyingly coarse at times—and I
suppose if you had done anything wrong you
wouldn’t pay me the compliment to deny it—but—well—I
give it up.”</p>

<p>“My mind is not perverted,” I said, “because
I see life as it is. I have lived in the world now
for eight years, and all my friends happen to have
married long since. I should have been a fool had
I not seen and heard what life meant to many
people, even if I never had had any confidences
made me. But it has not stained my mind in the
least, because it is something I never think of
when by myself—which is the result of accepting
life and human nature as they are not as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
ought to be. I will not pretend to say, however,
that I do not sympathize with women who are
carried away by passion. I do not see how a
woman who has any passion——”</p>

<p>“Lady Helen! I cannot let you go any further.
I am willing to admit that there is sin in the world,
but there are certain standards of refinement in this
country that I will not hear violated.”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I mean that—well—that I cannot listen to a
woman admit that she has passions exactly like a
man.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you never heard that before?”
I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Never! There are certain obligations—but—Oh,
don’t let us talk of it. There is one thing further
I feel I must say—and I am hoping you will
pardon me, for we are all hoping and longing to
keep you among us—you and dear Lady Agatha,
although of course we know that we must lose
the clever Duke when he is well enough to go
home——”</p>

<p>She paused, and I gave her my most encouraging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
smile. We were on the veranda now and she
sat opposite me, leaning forward alertly.</p>

<p>“It is this,” she said with her anxious smile.
“We all do so want you to marry our dear brilliant
accomplished Mr. Rogers, and not Mr. Nugent.
<i>He</i> is not really one of us, and, I am afraid
he is not too high-principled and has not led an
immaculate life—like Mr. Rogers.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?”</p>

<p>“By their faces. Look at Mr. Rogers’. It is refinement
itself, almost ascetic. Mr. Nugent looks—well—of
course he is a gentleman and irreproachable
in society, but I <i>know</i> he has not led
a regular life.”</p>

<p>“I am sure he has not, and it is really none of
our business.”</p>

<p>“I believe that men should be as pure as women,”
she said setting her lips.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they should, but they are not; you
see there are so many women who make a business
of tempting them from the time they begin
to take notice that it is quite unreasonable to expect
them to attain the feminine standard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“I am not talking of bad women.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but they count so, you know. They count
because they are the positive force. Virtue is too
negative to influence any one but those who are
virtuous by nature or circumstance. But as I said
before, dear Mrs. Hammond, facts are facts. Why
not accept them, and without so much mental
wear and tear? Every man has the privilege
of leading his own life, so long as he keeps
within the law. And if he does not think he
is doing wrong, if he does not violate his conscience,
then he does himself no moral harm
so long as he sins like a gentleman. Of course
no one wants the coarse sensualist near one;
he is repulsive and should herd with his own
kind.”</p>

<p>“And you mean to say you extenuate—you
would marry a man who had—who had—made
love to many women? I am interested in your
views, but I must reiterate that I think if social
exigencies compel us to meet such men we should
at least discourage their kind by refusing to marry
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>She looked pale and nervous but her eyes were
bright with curiosity.</p>

<p>“I will tell you my theory,” I said, “and I can
assure you that I did not jump at it. As I told
you, I have seen a good deal of the world, the
best of it as well as some of its worst. This is my
idea—But first: If God is incarnate in good men
and the devil in bad why are bad men invariably
more fascinating to women—even to pure women—than
good men? I am talking of course of the
devil which dwells in masculine and able men, not
in the silly and ingenuous sensualist. Now the men
who are wholly irresistible are those who combine
both God and devil, who stimulate and intensify
the soul and the imagination as well as the passions.
This confounds orthodoxy, but does not to
my mind deepen the mystery. Is not this combination,
perhaps, the perfect man? And as man is—we
believe—made in the divine image—may
not God and the devil be one rounded being?
Why does the ‘perfect’ man and woman invariably
irritate and antagonize, even have a bad influence,—arousing
the devil of perversity—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the perfection is in the least self-conscious? Is it not
because we instinctively feel their failure to achieve
the standard we have accepted as divine, and resent
the imposition? And can such a one-sided being
give happiness? Not any more than the lowest
brute. Therefore, I maintain that a man to reach
full stature must have room in his soul for God
and the devil to jog along peacefully side by side.”</p>

<p>She rose, white and aghast. “I never, never
heard anything to approximate that for audacity—and—and—terrible
profanity. But I am too
nervous to argue with you. I see Mrs. Laurence
coming. Please tell her—<i>she</i> is so brilliant, so
gifted. I know she could refute——”</p>

<p>“Please tell her that I have not had a walk to-day!
that I shall have a violent headache if I miss
it! <i>Please</i> be an angel and don’t tell her I saw her
coming—” and I almost ran to the back veranda
and plunged into the woods. I had screwed up
my courage to the highest pitch and I knew I
couldn’t do it a second time. I felt nervous, almost
excited, and I wanted a walk and the solitude
of the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>I walked rapidly down the trail for ten or fifteen
minutes, then felt a sudden desire to see that
precipitous magnificent avenue made by the roadway.
I entered it presently and walked down the
logs as rapidly as I could, for the exercise; pausing
whenever I reached a ledge—in these woods
you cannot walk and admire at the same time unless
you care to run the risk of a broken ankle—to
drink in that wild yet awesome perspective of
the forest. The trees are so high, and often their
branches leap across and clasp hands!—and crowding
upon the heels of the advance guard is the
green, fragrant, ancient army, a million strong. And
every now and again the distant mountain beyond
the high wild valley.</p>

<p>I suddenly became possessed with a desire to
get closer to that mountain, to get away from my
own for a little while. I knew that it could not
be more than four miles off, and I could easily
make the distance and return before dark. I almost
felt as if I were running away, and hurried
on eagerly.</p>

<p>I passed Mr. Rolfs sitting cross-legged on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
damp boulder, communing—presumably—with
God. There was a note-book beside him. He
looked like an omniscient owl. As I passed he
bowed gravely but did not speak. I am positive
he cannot endure me.</p>

<p>I went down the mountain as rapidly as I could,
but that is saying little. What between picking
my way over logs that slipped and stones that
cut and feeling for dry land through the grass by
the roadside I was fully an hour reaching the
valley. It was just a few moments before making
the last precipitous descent, when I paused for a
moment on a ledge and fanned myself that I became
aware how hot and sultry it was. Almost at
the same moment I heard the loud familiar rumble
of the approaching storm.</p>

<p>It would take me longer to reach home than it
had done to pick my way down that beastly road.
There was nothing to do but make for the valley
and the nearest house, and the sudden brief copper
of the sky made me hasten on with all speed.
I do not experience any sinking physical fear during
a thunder-storm but I have a mental appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of the danger and I prefer to be within four
walls with the doors and windows closed. The
storm was still far off, for the intervals between
the flash and the clap were quite long, and its
rain was deluging some other mountain miles
away.</p>

<p>At last I was free of the woods and stood in
the great valley with its irregular masses of mountains
on every side, its rivers, its wide peaceful
clearings, and alas! its cows. There was no building
within a mile except a dilapidated Catholic
church, the most mournful object I ever saw in a
landscape. Half of the roof was gone, a thousand
rains had washed its last coat of paint away, the
fence was but a few broken sticks, and the grass
and weeds grew high over three or four poor forgotten
graves. There was a French colony about
here, long since.</p>

<p>It was not an attractive refuge, but the great
thunder cloud was pushing its way across the
Eastern mountain, forked and torn with fire, and
roaring as if it were Hell moving up to Summer
quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>I was therefore about to make for the ruin
when I heard the sound of a sob and of running
feet behind me. I turned quickly and saw,
running toward me and wringing her hands, a
slight pretty girl, with a mass of fluffy hair surmounted
by an immense hat covered with blue
feathers.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, wait for me,” she cried. “I’m so
skaret, and I’ve been runnin’ roun’ like I was
crazy. Its a mile to the nearest farm and I
dassent go in that spooky church by myself.
Oh, my Gawd, ain’t it awful.”</p>

<p>“Why, there are thunder-storms nearly every
day,” I said soothingly. “There is really nothing
to be afraid of. Let us go into the church,
by all means.”</p>

<p>I was glad of her company, to tell you the
truth, and led the way rapidly to the ruin. The
door was locked! but we picked our way to the
back, past those desolate graves, and entered
where a wall had fallen in. It was not an easy
task to scramble over the mouldering remains of
roof and wall, but we accomplished it and ensconced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
ourselves in a pew in that end of the
structure which was still whole enough to afford
shelter, although how much of safety was doubtful.</p>

<p>We were none too soon. Almost immediately
the rain came down with that furious energy
characteristic of storms in these mountains, the
thunder was really appalling, and the lightning
seemed to have got beyond control of itself—the
forks cut its steady blaze. My companion had
possessed herself of my hand and cowered against
me. Her vernacular as exhibited in a disconnected
monologue quite distracted my mind from
the storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Gawd,” she would mutter; then
with a violent start: “Gee whizz! Wat for did I
ever come up to these mountains and I alwus so
afraid of lightnin’? O-w-w! Oh, Lordy I’ll never
do it agin, I vow I won’t. Oh, Joc <i>why</i> ain’t you
here? I’m skaret plum to death. I know I’ll be
struck clean to kingdom come, and I ain’t so
bad. I really ain’t. Oh, Joc you ain’t treaten’ me
right to be safe down there in Noo York and me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
goin’ to be kilt for ever up on these wicked
mountins.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the electricity had other havoc to
accomplish before its force was spent, and passed
quickly, leaving only the rain behind it. She recovered
herself almost as quickly and sat up and
smoothed her hair, then took off her hat and regarded
the feathers.</p>

<p>“They ain’t wet, thank heavings,” she said,
then readjusted it carefully; after which she
turned and regarded me with suspicion. She was
a pretty dainty creature, not as common as you
would expect, for the national delicacy of feature
and sensitiveness of expression seem quite as
impartial as democracy could demand.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she asked. “I ain’t seen you
before in these parts.”</p>

<p>“I am on the mountain, at Boulder Lake.”</p>

<p>A light flashed into her damp eyes. “Aw, now,
you ain’t that there Lady Helen somethin’, a
dook’s sister, what everybody is talkin’ about?”</p>

<p>I bowed in as graceful acknowledgment as I
could muster and she pursued delightedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“You look like it and I’ve seen a lord as
didn’t, but you look just like you might be the
hero<i>ine</i> of a story in the ‘Family Herald’.”</p>

<p>“I have not the pleasure of the ‘Family
Herald’s’ acquaintance,” I said, smiling genially,
for she interested me as another variety of the
genus American, “but tell me something of
yourself. You are not a mountain girl, I infer.”</p>

<p>“Cheese it!” she exclaimed scornfully. “Do I
look like these here lumps that is as broad as they
is long and wear their hair as slick as a rat’s tail?
Naw, I’m a Noo Yorker born and bred, and I’m
a sales-lady in ——<a id="FNanchor_4i" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> See?”</p>

<p>“You mean—a—shop girl?”</p>

<p>“Naw. We don’t use that there kind of language
in this country. This is the United States
of Ameriky and we’re all free and equal.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” I exclaimed eagerly. “Do <i>you</i> really
hold to that? How refreshing. Then you don’t
look down on these mountain girls that usually
have to work as servants?”</p>

<p>“Gee!” she exclaimed indignantly, “I guess I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
do. Servants is one thing and sales-ladies is another.
And I ain’t never goin’ to the mountins
agin for vacations—not while there’s cheap hotels
at Asbury Park, and Ocean Grove. I ain’t used to
settin at table with servants, or ‘hired help’ as
they call themselves. But a lady frien’ of mine’s
got an aunt up here and she giv me no peace till I
come, I was that near dead with work and heat.”</p>

<p>If I were of an hysterical turn I probably should
have succumbed. But I maintained a becoming
gravity and looked at her with that concentrated
interest which forces people to talk about themselves.</p>

<p>“But,” I said diffidently,—“as you have told
me you work you won’t mind my alluding to it—suppose
you had been less clever than you are or
had had less influence than you did have—and
had been forced to go out as a servant——”</p>

<p>“I’d ’a been a fluff first—naw, I don’t mean
that. But I just wasn’t—that’s all. And I guess I
ain’t goin’ to associate with those beneath me
when I don’t have to. Wouldn’t I be a fool if I
did?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“You certainly would not be a good American.
But if you call yourself ‘sales-lady’ why
should not the poor servant be permitted to ease
her self-respect by calling herself ‘hired help’?”</p>

<p>“She kin, for all of me, but it don’t make her
nothin’ else. I hear somebody comin’”—her voice
fell to a terrified whisper. “Oh, lordy, I hope it
ain’t a tramp.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Rogers. His anxious face appeared
above the rubbish, and I spoke immediately.</p>

<p>“What a relief!” he exclaimed, as he picked
his way toward us. “I heard voices and hoped
you might be here.”</p>

<p>“It is good to see you,” I said. “How do you
happen to be down in the valley?”</p>

<p>“It was just after the first rumble that I met
Rolfs coming out of the forest. He told me you
had passed him and I immediately got an umbrella,
told the Duke I was going in search of
you, and started off. I have been quite alarmed,
and am more relieved than I can say.”</p>

<p>I smiled and gave him my hand, when my sales-lady
remarked drily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Well, as three’s a crowd and it ain’t rainin’ any
more I guess I’ll waltz. Pleased to meet you, Lady
Helen. I kin alwus see a real flesh and blood
Lady of the nobility now when I’m readin’ the
‘Herald’ or —— —— ——’s<a id="FNanchor_4j" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> lovely novels.
Good-bye. Hope you’ll git up the mountin O. K.”
And she took herself and her feathers out of the
ruin.</p>

<p>“I think we had better start for home,” said
Mr. Rogers. “Your brother and Lady Agatha
will be so anxious.”</p>

<p>“But you must be tired——”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. Do you think no one can
walk but the English?” This with a smile and
intonation that took all abruptness out of it.</p>

<p>We left the church and in a few moments were
climbing the mountain, a doubly difficult task
now that the logs were slippery with rain. But the
forest was so green and dripping, the sun-flecks
glittered in the rain-drops, the depths looked so
dark and wet, and full of sweet fragrant mystery!
The odour of the balsam came down to us with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
rush. Mr. Rogers is a pleasant companion at all
times, but I like him particularly in the forest.
He seems to need it so, to be so grateful for it. I
fear I have only a dim inkling of what this brief
dip into the wilderness means to the tired nervous
practical New Yorker.</p>

<p>“I hear you want to leave us,” he said presently.</p>

<p>“Only for a few days. I am curious to see other
lakes and other parts of the forest.”</p>

<p>“And other people? I am afraid you do not
like my friends as well as I had hoped.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you are wrong,” I exclaimed with the
warmth of insincerity. “They interest me tremendously.
They are too clever for me, that is
all. I don’t feel up to them.”</p>

<p>“You are far cleverer than any of them,” he replied,
turning upon me that <i>approving</i> expression
of which I have written, and smiling a trifle of
warmth into his grave face. “Many of them are
beginning to admit it quite frankly. The American
nature is very generous, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laurence and Mr. Rolfs never have admitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
anything of the sort, I’ll wager,” I cried
gaily.</p>

<p>“Well—no; but you see they are rather
spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Nor Mr. William Lee Randolph,” I said, alluding
to an author who arrived two days ago. “I
dreamed all last night of cutting his conceit into
little bits and watching them fly together again
and cohere as snugly as if nothing had happened.”</p>

<p>“You are a severe critic, dear Lady Helen——”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> horrid of me to criticise your friends.
And after your many-sided kindness! I feel a
rude little beast.”</p>

<p>“If you were not frank with me about everything
I should be greatly disappointed. And—I
am quite willing to admit it to you—your frankness
is very refreshing to me. I get very tired of
all this posing and hero-worship and these everlasting
fads. But they are inevitable in all circles
where certain of its members have accomplished
great things and others feel that their rôle is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
admire extravagantly if they would keep their
heads above water and feel in the swim.”</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> think Mr. Rolfs and Mrs. Laurence
and Mr. Randolph great?” I asked pointedly.
“Now, you be just as frank as I am for once.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then said: “I believe
there is no admission I would not make to you,
if you only gave me sufficient encouragement.
Be careful of that mud hole—these stones are
better. I do wish you would wear rubbers. Frankly
then I do not think that any of my authors are
great, but I think it best to convince the world
that they are because they are unquestionably on
the right track and their success will encourage
the younger talent to follow in their footsteps,
crowning the achievement of to-day with the
richer harvest of a more virile generation. I am
quite aware that we lack virility, but when a
more full-blooded generation does arrive think of
the vast advantage it will have in this skeleton
example of flawless art and perfect taste.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me more likely that there will be
a violent reaction,” I said. “That they will smash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
your porcelain skeleton to smithereens and build
a big rude lusty giant in its place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” he said anxiously, “I hope
not. That <i>would</i> be a life-time thrown away.”</p>

<p>It was the first time I had heard him sigh, and
the momentary unconscious appeal to my sympathy
touched me sharply.</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> lived for something besides self!”
I exclaimed. “I believe you actually have given
your best energies, and all your time and much of
your fortune to building up an Art in your country
that future generations may be benefited by and
proud of. I do hope for your sake that it will be
a success.”</p>

<p>He turned to me with such a glow on his face
that I realized I had gone too far for once, and
had a wild desire to pick up my skirts and run
headlong into the forest. I must say he looked
handsome and most attractive. It seemed to me
that I felt something glow and leap beside me,
something that I never had admitted the existence
of, but which gave him a distinct fascination.
I could not run, and heaven knows what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
might have happened next. But at that moment
a turn of the road brought us face to face with
Mr. Nugent.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he exclaimed, “Oh! <i>What</i> a relief. I
knew of course that Rogers would find you—but
what might have happened before—Were you in
the woods during the storm?”</p>

<p>“I was in the Catholic Church with a sales-lady
from New York who demanded so much solace
that I had no time to be frightened, myself.” I
plunged at once into a description of the adventure,
out of kindness to Mr. Rogers as much
as to disembarrass the situation. I knew the violent
reaction within him—and I hoped he was
communing with his soul in good healthy swear
words.</p>

<p>When I did not talk, Mr. Nugent did, and
Mr. Rogers’ silence was well covered. Not that
he did not recover himself almost immediately,
and occasionally put in an apt remark.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Nugent dismissed the subject of
sales-ladies with his usual abruptness.</p>

<p>“I think I can say that I have persuaded your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
brother and sister to let you go to-morrow,” he
said. “I demonstrated the absurdity of such slavish
adherence to the conventions in this wilderness.
Your maid is chaperonage enough for a few
hours’ trip, to say nothing of the fact that Hunter
and another man will carry your trunk behind us
down the mountain and that still another man
with a buckboard will meet us in the valley.”</p>

<p>My eyes danced. “What a lark!” I exclaimed.
“To really go on a trip without Bertie or Agatha.
But <i>will</i> they consent?”</p>

<p>“I am sure they will. I told them that if they
insisted upon it my sister would come for you,
and although of course they would not hear of
such a thing I think that clinched them. So be
prepared to start to-morrow morning at eight.”</p>

<p>And, Polly, I really believe I am going! My
love to you.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Helen.</span><br>
</p>

<p>P. S. I almost apologize to Mr. Rolfs. This
evening at the Club House when Mrs. Hammond
was sitting forward and monopolizing the conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
as she always does when Mrs. Laurence does
not happen to be present, and delivering her entirely
commonplace opinions with a vigour of enunciation
and a raptness of expression which convince
the unanalytical that she is quite the reverse of
the little goose she is, Mr. Rolfs suddenly turned
to me with such an expression of ferocious disgust
that involuntarily I moved closer to him.</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is what we have to write for!” he exclaimed.
“There are thousands, tens of thousands
of these damned fool women that we have to
write down to and pose to if we want to make
our bread and butter.”</p>

<p>I almost gasped. “What on earth do you
mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I like you. You’ve got horse sense and
see through the whole blamed show. You think
I’m an ass, and I am. I have to be. I nearly
starved trying to be a man, so I became an emasculated
backboneless poseur to please the passionless
women and the timid publishers of the
United States. To please the sort of American
woman who makes the success of a novelist—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
faddist and the gusher—you must tickle her with
the idea that she is a superior being because she
has no passion and that you are creating a literature
which only she can appreciate—she with a
refinement and a bleached and laundried set of
tastes which have made her a tyrannical middle-class
enthusiast for all that is unreal and petty in
art!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said, “Oh!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been born an Englishman,” he
pursued viciously. “To be great in English literature
you’ve only to be dull; but to be great in
American literature you’ve got to be a eunuch.”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Chipmunk Lake</i>,<br>
July 27th</p>

<p><i>Dear Polly</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. NUGENT, the all conquering, arranged
it, Polly dear, and here I am at
a far more beautiful lake than Boulder—which
seems tamely pretty in comparison. It is
on top of another mountain surrounded by another
dense forest which grows down into the
very water; but there the resemblance ends. Although
not large it is almost like four different
lakes, so irregular and cut up is it. From the
natural terrace on which the four camps are built
you look over a small body of brown water
fringed with reeds and water-lilies to two mountain
peninsulas which jut so far into the lake as
almost to close it. The opening is called The
Narrows and just beyond and across the distance
runs another high sloping mountain quite cutting
off further view except of far pale peaks. It is
only when you are in a boat beyond The Narrows
that you see the lake’s three other parts, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
end closed up with great rocks and floating logs,
but with the avenue of the inlet showing beyond;
everywhere else, the dense silent forest, the spruce
crowding to the front, the water-lilies and their
pads spreading almost to the middle of the lake.
There are white lilies and yellow ones and a
miniature variety with so sweet and intoxicating
a fragrance that in the early morning you feel as
if the boat were cutting a visible passage through
it. And the mountains, mountains, everywhere.</p>

<p>The four cottages are made of logs, three with
the bark on, the other peeled and polished. Mrs.
Van Worden’s is the largest and also the most
homelike. We arrived rather late. Mr. N.
and I, tired of the “buckboard,” had left it and
walked on ahead, arriving quite noiselessly. I
never shall forget how comfy Mrs. Van Worden’s
living-room looked as we peered a moment
through the glass door before knocking. It is
a long low room with heavy beams across the
dark red paper of the ceiling, and a red brick
fireplace from floor to roof—in which great logs
were blazing. In one corner was a graceful staircase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and on the “sealed” gold-coloured walls
were many prints and photographs of sporting life
in the Adirondacks. In one corner was a divan
piled with cushions and draped with silk, a lamp
swinging from the canopy. Against another wall
was a straight divan, on which a young man was
lying, reading a book. Then there were mounted
deer heads and rugs and tables and at least eight
rocking-chairs—I am going to take back a
“rocker” as a present for you.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Worden, who was standing with her
foot on the fender staring into the fire, seemed
to feel our presence in a moment, for she turned
about suddenly and came swiftly to the door.
And then the warmth of her welcome quite dissipated
the misgivings I had felt about descending
in this summary fashion upon a complete
stranger. I like her better than any woman I
have met in the country and as we sat up talking
half the night, I already know her quite well.</p>

<p>She is tall and thin, with no figure exquisitely
dressed—though with much more simplicity than
the fashion of Boulder Lake would dictate. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
these women <i>have</i> to dress so much oftener during
other parts of the year that they are more disposed
to a complete rest up here. Still, they
can’t help dressing well. Her figure’s only
“points” are the hands and feet, which are so
small that I stare at them almost rudely. Nevertheless
the hands look extremely determined.
She is not pretty but has rather the beauty of
individuality. Her complexion is dead white, almost
transparent, and her nose irregular, but she
has great glowing black eyes, a sensitive and
beautiful mouth, and soft mahogany-brown hair
charmingly arranged. She is about six-and-thirty,
I should say, and when she hinted to me that she
was nine-and-twenty I felt disposed to offer her
my confidence without reserve. Never trust a
woman who will not lie about her age after thirty.
She is unwomanly and unhuman and there is no
knowing what crimes she will commit.</p>

<p>The man on the divan—a long clean-limbed
smooth faced delightful looking young fellow,
with a humorous mouth, a frank eye and a fine
high-bred <i>University</i> air about him—stood up as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
soon as we entered and was presented as Mr. Latimer
of New York. Mr. Van Worden is a banker,
very business-like and absent minded, and years
older than his wife.</p>

<p>We had the jolliest little supper in one corner
of the living-room—at least four of us did, for Mr.
Van Worden was on the lake, having dined—and
were waited on by the lake-keeper’s wife, a woman
of immense weight, but so light on her feet and so
deft and swift in her movements that she might
have been a fairy. More of her later. She interests
me very much.</p>

<p>After supper, as it was blowing rather hard, we
all sat about the blazing logs for two hours and
Mrs. Van Worden and young Latimer rattled alternately.
But they did not irritate me for a moment,
they were so impersonal even when talking
of themselves, so really clever without seeming to
be in the least aware of it, so full of a humour
that made no attempt at wit, and so interesting in
what they had to say and in their manner of looking at things.
I felt grateful enough to hug myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Mr. Latimer had recently been in the Philippines
and he told some of his humorous adventures
with a boyish abandon—I am told he is
thirty but he seems much younger—that made
me laugh heartily. Suddenly I caught Mr. Nugent’s
eye and the expression of delight on his
face made me blush to my hair. We were alone
for a moment just before going to bed and he
whispered to me eagerly:</p>

<p>“You like it here! I know that you do! I am
so glad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” I exclaimed with the enthusiasm
of sheer gratitude. “I do. Thank you for bringing
me.” Here he looked as if nothing could prevent
him from kissing me and I said hurriedly:</p>

<p>“What a difference! It reminds me of something
the Prince is reported to have said once:
‘Bright people—yes; but no damned intellect.’”
Not but what I fancy the intellect is really there,
Polly, but it is reserved as a sub-stratum, from
which little sparks are sent up to irradiate, not
a constant conscientious blaze like an energetic
thunder storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Mrs. Van Worden invited me into her bed-room
and we muffled ourselves in warm wrappers and
talked for hours while the wind howled. She really
has seen the world, and is as interesting as—well,
as you are. There is a woman who would
sympathise with you from A to Z and never criticise.
Fancy the attitude of Mrs. Laurence or Mrs.
Hammond. What is Christianity, anyhow? A
kind heart and a sophisticated mind?</p>

<p>The next morning I got up for a few moments
at six and peered out of my high window. Some
of the smaller trees have been cut down and I
could see a little distance into the forest. It looked
so quiet—so expectant. I have decided that that
is the spirit of these mountain forests of the New
World—expectancy, waiting. Civilisation is held
in check at present by the laws of New York,
which owns the greater portion of the Adirondack
tract. But for how long? And they have had
more than a glimpse of man, these forests, from
the old dead trappers to the flowers of modern
and greedy civilisation. What is it they expect?
What disaster? What conquests? It seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
me sometimes as if they were holding their
breath. And what are they like inside? I wish I
had eyes to see? Besides the two thousand lakes
there are springs, springs everywhere; there must
be millions of them in the great range. From what
vast subterranean flood do they burst forth?
What silent potent <i>waiting</i> tides are moving unceasingly
beneath the brown lakes and the riches
of the forest, have been moving since the great
glaciers melted?</p>

<p>At eight the keeper’s wife, Mrs. Opp, came up
with my breakfast—coffee, and “johnnie cake,”
and fish, fresh from the lake, and I detained her
for a few moments, for she interests me unaccountably.
As I said, she is very fat—she must
weigh not a pound less than seventeen stone—and
cannot be under five feet nine. Her face is German,
but the features are small and delicately cut,
and her complexion is as fine of grain as an infant’s.
She must be seven or eight and thirty, but
her face has that virginal expression of the married
woman who never has had children. Her manner
is <i>gracious</i>—I cannot apply any other word to it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
but even more noticeable, I think, are her teeth
and nails. They are perfect and perfectly kept.
And yet she is illiterate, and has, she let fall,
worked all her life. When Mrs. Van Worden is
here she is both cook and housekeeper. Her husband,
the keeper, is a big lithe handsome man,
with regular features and a white throat. In his
rough costume he looks the ideal mountaineer.</p>

<p>“I am not going to be lazy every day,” I remarked
apologetically. “But I walked nearly all
the way yesterday and then sat up late.”</p>

<p>“No wonder yor’re tired,” she said in her crooning
indulgent voice. “A mile of it jest kills me. I
git het up so, and my poor legs are <i>that</i> tired—Oh,
my!” And she laughed a jolly laugh, as if, however,
life were all sunshine.</p>

<p>“But surely you walk sometimes in these beautiful
woods.”</p>

<p>“Not very much. I git about enough walkin’
round the house. When I go out of the woods in
winter and visit hum fur a spell, well, then, I guess
I do go about more. You see there’s somethin’ to
go to, but up here—My! I worked in hotels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
mostly before I come here, so this seems kinder
lonesome.”</p>

<p>“You don’t remain here in winter then? I don’t
blame you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t. It’s that dismal! Frank, he
comes in and out, but there ain’t no real need of
me stayin’ here so I go home and have a real good
time. I like it here. I like it here. It’s as good’s
anywheres, only I’d have a hotel on the St. Lawrence
if I could hev my choice. There’d be some
life in that! Well, I must go down and not stand
gassin’ here. Sure you got all you want? There’s
lots more.”</p>

<p>I assured her that I had more than I could possibly
eat, and she smiled graciously upon me and
withdrew. She is like the policeman and Jemima
and the sales-lady in her unconsciousness of caste,
but with a difference. What that difference is puzzles
me when I have time to think about it.</p>


<p class="right">July 31st</p>

<p>I have been here four days, Poll, and not heard
the words “aristocratic” or “refined” once. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
blessed relief! And—yet—they just lack unselfconsciousness.
Is that the word, or is it a suggestion
of reserve under all their animation and candour
and naturalness, a reserve that is not so much mental
and personal as racial and as—well, there is no
help for it—aristocratic? I think that is the explanation,
after all. They <i>feel</i> themselves to be
the true aristocrats of the country but are too well-bred
to mention, or, perhaps, to think of it. There
is just the faintest dearest little air of loftiness about
them and it is so manifestly natural that I fancy
it is as much the real thing as the “self-made”
American. I have come to the conclusion that the
modern interpretation of the Declaration of Independence
is something like this: <i>I am as good as
those that think themselves better and a long sight better
than those who only think themselves as good.</i> When
they are established on the top step like these people
here, with no more flights to conquer, there is
really nothing left to do but to slide down the
banisters.</p>

<p>None of my Chipmunk Lake friends are of the
“new-rich”; every fortune up here is at least three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
generations old, and Mr. Van W’s is six. Well,
they are welcome to feel themselves anything
they like, for I find them wholly delightful, and
they have been charming to me. Mrs. Wilbur
Garrison looks rather sad and tired but is always
gay in manner and interested in what other people
are talking about. Mrs. Reginald Grant has
several pasts in the depths of her eyes which her
long lashes always seem to be sweeping aside as
if it were a matter of no consequence whatever.
Mrs. Meredith Jones rather goes in for charities,
and Mr. Nugent says she really is a hard worker
as well as a devoted mother and an irresistible coquette.
She has a Greek profile, a cloud of golden
hair, a Juno bust and a rather cynical mouth.</p>

<p>I do not know what Mrs. Hammond meant by
saying there were “no men.” I should say there
was one apiece.</p>

<p>There is a young widow, a great belle, visiting
Mrs. Grant—Mrs. Coward. She is very thin and
not in the least beautiful, although her face lights
up when she talks and has a sweet expression.
But she holds herself with a calm expectancy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
every man will fall at her feet, and she flatters
more than any one I ever met. Then she delivers
her opinions with such an air! They are usually
platitudes, but you know how a manner blinds.</p>

<p>A Miss Page, a Southern girl, is visiting Mrs.
Garrison. She has an ideal manner, is always impersonal
in her conversation and seems as amiable
and unselfish as possible.</p>

<p>The unmarried men live in the little Club
House, which has a smoking-room but no dining-room.
We all dine in our own camps when we are
not entertaining each other, which is usually.</p>

<p>The children are established for the summer in
other country houses, where all these people will
go after their three weeks’ rest from every care.
The two husbands up here are quite nice, and devoted
to sport. When the fish won’t play in this
lake they tramp off to others.</p>

<p>But enough of the people. I am going to tell
you of the weirdest experience I ever had. Save
it for me, Polly, for if ever I write a book I certainly
shall put it in.</p>

<p>First—Last evening at sundown several of us—two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> 
in a boat—went out on the lake in the hope
of seeing the deer come down to drink. The men
paddled, making so little noise and movement that
the boat seemed gliding by itself through the silences
of space. There was a yellow glow in the
West—the aftermath of the most magnificent
amber sunset; mountains and lakes of molten
cloud—but the stars were not out and there was
only that light from nowhere through which the
vision gropes surely but always with surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Nugent paddled our boat—he sat in the
stern, I in the bow, with my back to him—through
the Narrows, then, after drifting about
for a few moments pointed toward the shore most
distant. I had been warned not to speak, and not
a word had been uttered when a low suppressed
voice from behind gave me a start. “Look, look!”
it said, “do you see? Straight ahead.” I saw! A
reddish brown something was walking along the
bank and in a moment I saw it toss its horns. But
it was not of the deer I thought just then but of
the strange sense of intimacy that suppressed voice
on the darkening silent lake had aroused in me. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
a moment it came again, lower still, for we were
nearing the shore. “There is another.” And he
steered through the water-lilies.</p>

<p>A mate had joined the buck and they cropped
and drank for a few moments, then walked along
the shore and into an arbour-like opening of the
forest, exactly like people making a stately exit
from the back of a stage. Almost immediately
two does came bounding out of the forest and
waded into the water until only their heads and
red backs were visible. We remained motionless,
almost breathless, but in a few moments
they must have noticed us for they made hotly
for the shore. When they reached it they stood
for at least five minutes with their heads thrown
back staring at us. Then, although we were, apparently,
as lifeless as the lily pads, their reasoning
faculty must have satisfied them that we were
aliens and therefore to be feared, for they suddenly
turned their backs and made for the forest as hard
as they could go, leaping over one high bush after
another, until nothing could be seen but the white
lining of their tails. Then the exhibition being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
over we talked all the way home, and that strange
sense of intimacy with a note of mystery in it was
dispelled.</p>

<p>It was to be renewed, however, for we had not
done with the deer. That night at eleven o’clock,
when Mr. Van Worden was sound asleep—he
really is very dull—Mrs. Van W. and I, Mr.
Nugent and Mr. Latimer stole down to the boat
house by the light of a lantern. We were muffled
up in the darkest things we possessed and I felt
exactly as if we were conspirators, or smugglers,
or refugees from justice.</p>

<p>In the boat house the men lit a lamp they had
brought and placed it in a wooden case, open in
front, which was on the end of a pole about three
feet high. (This light is called a Jack.) The pole
was set into a hole on the bow of the boat Mr. N.
intended to paddle, and it was to serve as a sort
of search light, not only to see the deer by, but
to fascinate what moth-like instinct they possessed.</p>

<p>All prepared, we pushed silently out into the
lake. Can you imagine the scene? The mountains—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
are so many of them!—were black.
The sky seemed dropping with its weight of
stars. The clear glassy lake reflected the largest
of them and the black masses of the forest that
rose straight from its brink. And just ahead of
me—shall I ever forget it?—floated a white mist,
rising and falling, writhing into a different semblance
every moment, the light making it the
more ghostly and terrifying. I could not see a
living thing; the other boat was behind us and I
was in the bow as before, staring at that ghostly
mist, quite forgetting the deer. A line of Tennyson’s
haunted me:</p>

<p class="center">“The dead steered by the dumb went upward with the flood,”</p>

<p>and I longed to utter it aloud, but dared not.
Once I turned my head to see if Mr. N. were
really there. He looked black and graven, as if
indeed he were the dumb servitor. The others I
could not see at all. And again there was that
sense of gliding, unpropelled, through the silences
of the upper Universe, only a thousand times
intensified. And, surely, never were so many stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
gathered together before. It seemed to me that
the big ones must drop into the lake, they looked
so heavy, and so close, and the little ones were
like a million grains of golden sand. I thought
of Grimm’s Fairy Tales and the princess who carried
a robe of stars in a nut-shell.</p>

<p>But more often I watched that white mist, just
in front of the prow and me, and nowhere else.
Where did it come from? I have no idea. They
tell me there was a mist everywhere, and that by
the aid of our light we saw it just ahead, but I
saw none of it elsewhere, and I saw the stars and
the trees in the lake.</p>

<p>We must have floated for a half hour, searching
almost every inch of the banks without a
glimpse of deer, when Mr. N.’s paddle stopped
suddenly. At the same moment I heard a slight
trampling in the brush close by, then a louder, as
if a great buck had been brought to bay and
were pawing up the earth. Then there was a terrific
snort—I had no idea anything could snort so
loud—then a long warning whistle, then another
snort, and another. By this time he had made up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
his mind to flee the danger, for the snorts were accompanied
by a crashing through the brush in the
opposite direction. The faster he went the louder
he snorted, until distance tempered the sound. It
must have been five minutes before the last faint
note of his anger came back to us.</p>

<p>“I am afraid he has warned off all the others,”
came that low hoarse whisper from behind me,
and it was the last touch needed to deepen the
mystery of that unreal midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. N. paddled for ten or fifteen minutes longer,
then giving it up, made for the boat house. We
glided in noiselessly and he helped me out at once
and extinguished the light. Then we stood on the
narrow pier between the boat and the other slip
of enclosed water waiting for Latimer and Mrs.
Van W. There was no sign of them on the dark
lake for several moments, and we were obliged to
stand very close on that strip of wood in the
darker boat house. I can assure you it was very
weird; but with a man like Mr. N. beside one
it was impossible to feel frightened. In the boat
he seemed so far away. Of course I imagined that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
all sorts of things had happened to the others, but
presently they came gliding toward us and into
the boat house. We all stole home—without a
word. It was long before I fell asleep.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Chipmunk Lake</i>,<br>
August 4th</p>

<p><i>Dear Polly?</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;HAVE solved the mystery of Mrs. Opp, and
it has been the cause of much thought and
speculation on my part. Her father was a German
noble, high in favour of his Kaiser some fifty
years ago. For some reason he fell from grace and
was expatriated, his estates confiscated. He came
to this country with a large family, drifted to one
of the Northern counties of New York State and
tried to make a living by farming. Of course he
was a failure, poor man, but he was highly respected
in the humble community, not only for his
worthy character, but because he could read and
write in seven languages. It was also known that he
corresponded with Bismarck. Some twelve years
after his arrival in the New World his youngest
child was born—she who now is Mrs. Opp, wife
of the keeper of Chipmunk Lake. By that time he
was a common farmer and woodsman, working
fourteen hours a day with his sons for a bare living,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
with neither the money nor the time to educate
his superfluous children. The little girl grew
up in the woods, turning her hand to everything,
from milking to making syrup from the maple
trees. When her father died and the farm was
divided she “hired out,” and supported herself
until she married, some ten years ago.</p>

<p>There you have the key to the mystery; the
unconscious pride of carriage, the gracious manner,
the well-kept teeth and nails, the more than
suggestion of breeding in her face. But all this
becomes strange only when you realize her absolute
unselfconsciousness. I have talked with the
woman over and over again and it is as plain as
her descent that she has not the slightest appreciation
of what she is and has been deprived of, much
less cherishes any pride or vanity in it. It is all
unconscious, this persistence of inherited instincts
through the most unfavourable circumstances,
with not an impulse in the brain to guide it. And
how short it stops, this heredity! It goes so far and
no farther; the brain, most important of all, is
choked with the weeds of a bitter fate. Still, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
is happy—why should I pity her? She has her
handsome woodsman, her placid mountain life,
that eternal <i>youngness</i> in her face. Courts could give
her nothing more; rather, would they give her
too much.</p>

<p>But how it sets one to thinking, Polly. I have
tried to imagine myself in similar circumstances:
Dad exiled with a large brood, myself born on a
mountain farm, “hired out”——The respectable
amount of brain I had inherited from a long line
of brilliant and useful men would be as surely mine
as now—but with nothing put into it, <i>could</i> it have
been wholly ignorant and unambitious and unsuspecting?
<i>Could</i> I have cooked without protest for
Mrs. Van Worden while her distinguished brother
addressed me merely to demand more potatoes or
the pepper? <i>Could</i> I have been content with finger
nails and teeth, and a backbone with a pride the
brain had forgotten? Oh, no! I cannot imagine it.
I should have demanded schooling, read my father’s
correspondence with Bismarck, fed myself with
his nightly tales of past splendour, and married an
American of the <i>haute noblesse</i>—in short, my heredity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
would have worked itself out along the lines of
the conventional novel, that is always so pleasantly
prone to give you life as it should be, not as it is.
Here I am face to face with a fact I never have
met in fiction, and I am grateful for it—even
while I feel sad as I speculate upon a fate I happily
have escaped. The Fact is Mrs. Opp of noble
blood and low degree, jolly, hearty, happy, unwarped
by what she knows not of ungrammatical—and
ambitious for a hotel on the St. Lawrence river.
Surely, there is a motif for a novel of advanced
realism.</p>

<p>I have talked it over with Mr. Nugent. He
is so interesting and illuminating to talk anything
over with. We take long walks and rows every
day. He is my constant cavalier, for it would be
really unprincipled of me to attempt to cut any
of these women out, they have been so sweet to
me. A party of us always start off together, but
there are so many paths in the forest!</p>

<p>I cannot analyze for you, Polly, the stage at
which I have arrived with Mr. Nugent. He has
not actually <i>said</i> anything, so far—he is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
clever—but he has a faculty of embracing me
with an invisible presentment of himself, which is
very disturbing. I don’t know what to think—except
that I think a great deal about him. It
is very sweet—but if only I could be sure. He
is so different—everything over here is so different
from anything I have ever known. (I don’t idealize
him. I wonder if that is fatal?)</p>


<p class="right">5th</p>

<p>We do not play intellectual games here, thank
heaven, and there is no idol on a pedestal, nor
one person who is more the fashion than another.
We are frivolous usually, although I have occasionally
heard some solid and instructive conversation,
and we all read a good deal. Every
house has several shelves of books, and the best
literature of all countries except the Great Republic
is well represented. Although I no longer
take much interest in the subject—and indeed
had observed long ago that the Americans of this
class cared little for their own bookmakers—I
asked Mrs. Van Worden the other day the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of it. She often answers in sentences so short
they sound like epigrams; however, brevity is
the soul as well as the substance of most epigrams,
as far as I am able to distinguish between
the short sentences of the witty novelists and the
paragraphs of those who think. For some reason
the staccato movement supplies a meaning of
which the words reck not.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van W. shrugged her flexible little
shoulders when I called her attention to the fact
that she had only three American novels in her
bookcase.</p>

<p>“Why should I waste my little time on the
obvious? I read what I do not know. I want
knowledge. Not of a new dialect and pin point
on a map, but of life, of the eternal mysteries. I
want the wisdom of those who are not afraid to
live and tell of what they have felt, thought,
done. I am not satiated, not blasée. I am still full
of hopes and dreams, and often I am quite
happy; but <i>I</i> have lived. Therefore I want to
read books by people who have lived more. How
could the surface—painted in water-colours by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
cautious hand—interest <i>me</i>. And the love scenes!
Rotten. Conducted through a telephone. I want
books written out of a brain and heart and soul
crowded and vital with Life, spelled with a big
L. I want poetry bursting with passion. I don’t
care a hang for the ‘verbal felicities.’ They’ll do
for the fringe, but I want the garment to warm
me first. Good God! how little true poetry there
is in our time; and I often feel the want of it so
terribly. I know the old boys by heart. Oh, for
a new Voice! What is the matter with the men,
anyway? Women make asses of themselves when
they try to be passionate and rhyme at the same
time, but I can see no reason why a man should
become so offensively ladylike the moment he
becomes a poet.”</p>

<p>“These are busy times,” I suggested. “Perhaps
the virile brains have found something better
to do. A poet always has seemed to me a
pretty poor apology for a man. Byron was masculine
but he was the great exception. And his
genius of personality was far greater than his
poetical gift, great, creatively, as that was. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
could stand a man being a poet incidentally, if he
had the power to make me forget he was a poet,
but not otherwise.”</p>

<p>And then we all went out on the lake in the
dusk and Mr. Nugent quoted Byron to me for
an hour. Not to my back. He was rowing this
time.</p>

<p class="right">6th</p>

<p>About two miles from here is a lake entirely
covered with water-lilies. It is seldom that a
boat cuts the surface or a fish line is cast, for the
water is too warm for trout, and our fishermen
disdain bull heads and sunfish. Consequently
the green lily pads have spread over every inch
of it, and scattered upon them are the waxen
cups with their golden treasure. It is a scene
of indescribable beauty and peace, and the low
hills above the shore, instead of the usual haughty
mountains, are almost as sweet and wildly still.</p>

<p>The keeper carried a boat there yesterday, and
Mr. N. rowed me about for an hour. I gathered
an armful of the lilies and hung them all over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
my hat and gown, linking the long soft stems in
my belt until they trailed to my knees. I felt so
happy in catching at the beautiful things as the
boat grinded through their hidden part, and in
adorning myself, that I quite forgot Mr. N., who
had fallen silent. The silence of one of these
Americans, by the way, is quite different from
that of our men. They are at so much pains
usually to entertain and interest a woman that
their silences indicate either a pleasant intimacy,
or depression, never a lordly superiority to small
matters. Therefore, I suddenly paused with a
cluster of lilies half raised and directed my
glance to my companion. He looked neither
musing nor sad. His eyes were fastened upon
me with eager admiration, his whole face, that
lean powerful nervous face stamped by unconquerable
emotions, was so concentrated, that I felt
myself blushing vividly, and I waved the cluster
of lilies at arm’s-length.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything so beautiful?”
I exclaimed gaily. “Is there any flower in the
world so artistic as the water-lily?—from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
pure cold form to its aloofness from the leaves?—and
always alone, never a blossom and its buds,
never a group, gathered as if in fragrant gossip.
It is the nun among flowers, sexless, childless,
angelically pure and cold, asking nothing of this
life but to bloom white and unspotted in some
mountain convent like this, a convent of perpetual
silence, with its wall of hills, its roof of
blue, embroidered with gold at night and haunted
by day with fleecy clouds that look like wandering
angels—Oh, dear! I forgot the thunder-storms
and the cries of angry deer, but doubtless
the lilies merely close up at such unholy sounds
and pray in unruffled serenity.”</p>

<p>“Lady Helen, will you marry me?” asked
Nugent.</p>

<p>Polly, I gave such a start that the boat rocked,
and I felt like a silly girl who never had been
proposed to before. Moreover, I blushed scarlet.
But, although I had, over and over, imagined
his proposal, none of my conceptions had been
anything like this. I had pictured him losing
his head suddenly when we were walking alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
in the woods, or keeping guard over the fire in
the living-room at night. I had—well, there is
no use going into details of what did not happen.
Suffice it to say that the proposal was delivered
in tersest English under a four o’clock sun,
while he had an oar in each hand. And as I
could not run away, and as he gave me not the
slightest excuse to be angry there was nothing
to do but to give him some sort of reply.</p>

<p>“To be perfectly honest, I don’t know,” I
said.</p>

<p>“You mean that you are not sure that you
love me, but that I may hope,” and his face
turned as crimson as mine—no easy feat, for it
is about the colour and consistency of leather.</p>

<p>“It is the sort of thing you can put in a good
many different ways. And there is so much to
be considered. You have the double magnetism
of mind and sex, you always interest and never
bore me, and you are entirely different from any
one I have ever known. I am twenty-six, and
like all women, eager to be in love—that I never
have been makes my longing for that particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
heritage the keener. Moreover, I am on the
rebound from two years of cruel anxiety, days
and nights of tears and waiting. For the first
time I feel that I belong to myself once more,
that the world and all its delights are mine—and
you happen to be the only man. How it would
be if I had met you in England in every-day conditions—that
is the problem I cannot solve.
These wild mountains, this life full of novelty,
the novelty of everything—Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Have you any prejudice against marrying an
American?”</p>

<p>“No prejudice. That is not the word. It is—well,
the very novelty that draws me to you is
what I am most afraid of. You see—as I said—I
never met any one in the least like you before.
The men I have known, whether Englishmen or
Europeans, are all men born of the same traditions
as myself. Fundamentally they are the
same, no matter what their individualities. But
you—you are just as different fundamentally as
every other way. How do I know but that your
great attraction for me is partly the spell of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
fascination, more still the novelty which appeals
to my somewhat various mind?”</p>

<p>“You certainly have given the matter some
thought,” he said, smiling with a sort of joyous
sarcasm, but in his usual harsh abrupt tones. “I’ll
debate the matter if you like. Your uncertainty
of mind is due to the fact that you have gone
fancy-free to the age of twenty-six. Unless a
woman early acquires the habit of falling in love,
it becomes more difficult every year—the disassociating
of the mind from the emotions—the
surrender of self—you struck me when I first
saw you as being so implacably proud in your
absolute self-ownership—it was delicious—I knew
you never had kissed any man—when will you
give me your answer?”</p>

<p>“When? Oh! Well—before—” brightening—“when
Bertie is quite well.”</p>

<p>“Your brother is as good as well now. Soulé
says there isn’t a microbe in him. The Adirondacks
and common sense are all he wants. He
has acquired both. Can you assert that you know
it would be utterly impossible to love me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Oh, no, I can’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Then take the plunge. I will answer for the
rest. You won’t love me before you marry me.
I feel sure of that. I am equally sure that you
will love me after. And all the differences from
your traditional man—they will transpose themselves
into commonplaces when they have become
the familiar details of daily life.”</p>

<p>“But English women never marry American
men,” I exclaimed, grasping wildly at a straw.
“It always is the other way.”</p>

<p>“There lies your chance for fame,” he said
more lightly than one would expect from his
face. “You are already the most delightfully
original of women. Don’t do anything so commonplace
as to go home, after having all your
blood made over by the Adirondack air, and
marry a great landlord with a rent-roll and six
titles. Fancy the stimulation of watching a determined
American throttling a fortune out of
his chaotic country, helping him in his ambitious
career, rising with him step by step until he is
head and shoulders above the seventy struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
millions of the United States of America. Does
not the prospect please you? You see I am practical.
I hate self-control. I know very little about
it. But I dare not be lover-like, not the least bit,
till you give me permission.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t! Yes, the life <i>would</i> be interesting.
But I adore politics. Would you throw
over that Trust and go in heart and soul for reform,
with the ultimate intention of being a distinguished
statesman?”</p>

<p>“Yes—but it would mean a curtailed income.”</p>

<p>“I have quantities of money—it <i>would</i> be
rather an original international match, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly would. And while you could expend
your entire income on dress and jewels if
you chose, you would have to make up your
mind to live according to <i>my</i> income.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“I <i>should</i> be a failure if I settled down to live
on a woman’s money at my age—forty-one—;
moreover my divorce from the interests of capitalism
would be deprived of its point. It would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the sacrifice that would tell most in the beginning.
No native of the British Isles would be accused
of the disinterestedness of marrying an unwealthy
American when protected by a rent-roll.
Nobody would suspect your income.”</p>

<p>“That is a nice polite thing to say to me!
How would you like the idea of people saying I
married you to be supported—with the inference
that no one in England would have me?”</p>

<p>“I do not care a red cent what any one says or
thinks if I get you. That is the only thing in
life that interests me at present.”</p>

<p>“Bertie might oppose it so violently that he
would have another hemorrhage.”</p>

<p>“If he were convinced that you loved me and
if you wept a few judicious tears, common gratitude
would force him to consent without a hemorrhage—and
if you postponed the announcement
a month he couldn’t have another if he tried. Besides,
he loves you devotedly—you know his
opposition would soon be exhausted. I have
seldom seen a brother and sister so united. He
would end by feeling with you and making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
vivid mental pictures of your great desire for
happiness—if I could only create that desire in
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” I said. “You must give me time.
I <i>can’t</i> say anything definite for days and days.
<i>Please</i> talk of something else.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of worrying you. Let us
land here. I have another lake to show you. If
this is a cloister, rapt and holy, that is a refuge
for lost souls, dank and sinister.”</p>

<p>Much interested, and delighted at his ready
conformity to my wishes, I stepped ashore and
followed him along a “runway” (deer run), for
about a mile. It turned and twisted through the
wood and sometimes we had to climb over fallen
trees, not having the lightsome feet of the deer—who
could leap a house, I should think. It was
not a dense wood, and the sunlight fairly tumbled
in, but so divided that it seemed palpable enough
to catch by the apronful. Some of the leaves
looked to be made of light, and a sea-gull—they
nest in these forests—seemed swimming and
drinking in an upper lake of sunshine. But, abruptly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
this charming impression was behind us.
The wood grew dark and I noticed that the
ground was very springy and soft—as our moors
are in places.</p>

<p>“We are on a swamp—made of the decay of
trees for a hundred years—” he said—“but you
are quite safe. It is at least five feet deep.”</p>

<p>This was sufficiently creepy—only five feet of
rotted bark and leaves between ourselves and the
lake—although I reflected that if it could support
trees, our additional weight would not sink it—but
in a moment we stood on the brink of the lake.</p>

<p>Polly, I never have seen so desolate a spot.
Even the mountains had deserted it. The forest
about it grew on land as flat as a plain, and the
trees hid the peaks which were only a few miles
distant. And so many of the trees were dead.
Lightning had blasted them and scarcely a
spruce had escaped the blight. All about the
shore the lake was choked with rotting trunks,
their naked branches projecting starkly above the
water—which had no movement. Its tarnished surface,
as ripless as a marsh, did not even reflect that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
deserted wood—they held themselves aloof from
each other; and yet they seemed dying together.
The lake has no inlet, Mr. N. had told me as we
came along; it is fed by springs and the moisture
of the forest. I could imagine it dropping lower
and lower, as the trees about it died, until—a
century hence?—a dry bed choked with rotting
trees would be visited as the tomb of one of Nature’s
failures. In England such a spot would be
the headquarters of a dozen dark and terrible
stories, and would have done threadbare duty in
fiction. But old as it is it is still too young for
that complicated thing called life to have centred
about it. It is on one of the New World’s peaks,
and not in another generation will she have time
to discover it. It is like those unhappy mortals
who die and rot before they have guessed that
there is aught in the world to live for. Poor
stranded ugly duckling. I felt more pity for it
than terror and almost resented the calm insolence
of its beautiful fellows—two thousand of
them, I am told. I wondered if its hidden springs
met and gossipped with other springs, who in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
turn poured their cold freshness into other lakes,
and with it their tale of a comrade forgotten by
Nature and despised by man. Doubtless they
would deepen their amber-brown in scorn, those
spoilt beauties of the mountains, worshipped of
men and darlings of Nature; not a ripple of pity
would agitate them, I would vow.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Mr. N.</p>

<p>He pushed his feet hard against the swamp,
putting much spring into his body—and for a
hundred yards the shore trembled, the trees
moved as if on a seesaw. My nerves are strong,
but that was too much. I grasped his arm.</p>

<p>“Come!” I said, “Take me away—please.
And do you go ahead. I want to look at a living
being till I get out of this wood.”</p>

<p>And we went back to the lake of the water-lilies,
that looked pure, and sweet, and happy
enough to pray for their lost neighbour.</p>


<p class="right">7th</p>

<p>This morning I sat watching the sunlight play
on the wrinkles of the lake where a light breeze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
blew. The glittering sun-flecks looked exactly
like a flock of tiny silver birds caught fast on the
surface of the lake and straining their wings even
to run away. Everyday I find something new
in this lake to interest me, and early this morning,
being unable to sleep, I rose and looked out
of my front window and saw a great deer, with
his antlers against the rosy dawn, standing on
one of the points of The Narrows. For a few
moments he listened intently, then waded out
among the lily pads and had his morning repast.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can imagine why I slept so ill last
night. Polly, I wish I knew my own mind. I am
afraid of making a mistake and afraid of throwing
away what may be my one supreme opportunity
to love. If I were only an American or he an
Englishman. If only I had the intuitive knowledge
of him and all that he will mean. I am beginning
to suspect that I have something of the pioneer,
of the discoverer in me. After all, why should not
one make great experiments in life? Obedience
to traditions, to habit, we see every day—and how
much happiness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>But I think I’ll be glad to get away from the
subject for a time.</p>

<p>I am rather keen for the autumn to come—“the
fall of the year”—when all these mountains
are a blaze of red and gold and the lakes reflect
their glory; when the dew freezes on these forest
flames and turns them to jewels that outdazzle the
stars; when the hunters with their red caps are in
them, not stalking the nimble deer, but sitting beside
the runways hour after hour, patiently waiting
the passing of the only lords left in these forests,
when we have venison three times a day and wonder
why we pined for it. There! that was as malicious
a drop as any of Heine’s, and I am sorry.</p>

<p>I saw such a laughable sight two days ago.
Mr. N. took me to the cow-yard to see it. Know
first that the deer flies are a pest in the land and
the terror of beasts. The solitary cow the colony
boasts was taking her afternoon nap, down on her
folded legs. Close to her head and perched along
her back were a half dozen hens with their heads
alert, watching the circling flies. The moment one
lit, the nearest chicken pounced and the fly disappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
never to torment cow or deer again. I saw
ten disposed of in this way, while the cow slumbered
peacefully, secure in her guard.</p>

<p>Have I told you that there is a deep ravine on
one side of the house? The veranda overhangs
it and I often stand and stare down into that wild
tangle of fallen trees and rocks and ferns. The
sides are broken and steep and under the shade
of many trees, straggling up into complete darkness.
The torrent is almost dry, but in winter
and spring it is broad and noisy and all the ferns
are covered and show green and lace-like under
the water. It is the outlet of the lake and it goes
far down into the valley where it tumbles over
a fall into another and wider stream. Up this
rocky steep mountain brook, over the cascade, the
trout climb in their thirst for the cold springs of
the higher lakes. No other fish can make that
perilous journey, so Chipmunk is one of the stars
of the Adirondacks. The trout have no minnows
or other small fish to feed on, and rise to the fly
with little coaxing. I am become so learned in
mountain lore! But I feel as if I had discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
this wonderful country, and as happy as a poet in
the nervous languor of creation.</p>

<p>You remember I wrote you of Mrs. Coward—and,
by the way she says she met you at Homburg
and in Scotland two years ago—I have concluded
that I do not like her quite as well as the
others, not because she is insatiable in her desire
for admiration and has several times flattered Mr.
N. right out of the room and on to the lake—how
can men be so weak?—when he is palpably
devoted to me and therefore in common decency
she should let him alone. Unless she mends her
ways I shall turn my batteries on Mr. Carlisle, a
dashing young millionaire who distinguished himself
in the late war, is a master of hounds, drives
a Tally-ho, is a champion at golf, never misses
the two deer a season the government permits
him to shoot, and is altogether very jolly and
charming. I could cut her out if I chose and without
flattering the animal either. That is a trick of
the mind to cover up the defects of nature.</p>

<p>But what I started to say was that the real reason
I dislike her is that I have discovered more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of the snob in her than in most of these Americans,
aspiring as they are—with the possible exception
of Mrs. Laurence. Yesterday morning I
“dropped” into Mrs. Grant’s lodge, and while the
servant went for Mrs. Coward—Mrs. Grant had a
headache—I picked up a framed photograph of a
very good-looking young man in the uniform of
the United States. I still held it when Mrs. Coward
came stepping down the stairs like the duchess
in the play, a red poppy in her dark hair, a
soft cream-white morning gown clinging to herself
and the floor—the morning was chilly. She
had a bunch of poppies in her belt and altogether
looked rather well.</p>

<p>“Is this your brother?” I asked. “I fancy I
see a resemblance.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “it is my soldier-brother.
He made a brilliant charge at Santiago and I am
very proud of him. Sit there, dear Lady Helen,
where the light falls full on you. You are so
radiant, bathed in sunlight—and you can stand
it. I always feel in the presence of poetry—a blue
and gold edition of all the poets—when I can sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and look at you like this. Poetry is really elevating,
don’t you think so?—I always maintain
that, positively. It is like pure air and the rural
beauties of the country. But about my brave
brother: it is only fondness that makes me proud
of him, for there never has been a generation in
our family where we have not given at least one
soldier to the country. Of course you will appreciate
that. Very few American families can say
that for <i>seven generations</i> its men have distinguished
themselves in the field and added to the
honour of the name.”</p>

<p>Her low silken shallow voice paused that I
might comment, but I only stared at the portrait—now
restored to the table—trying in vain to
frame a phrase that would express my awe of
the seven generations. Finally, I said desperately:</p>

<p>“He looks—really—as if the entire Spanish
army could not terrify him.”</p>

<p>This extravagance served the purpose of diversion.
“Nothing could terrify him,” she exclaimed.
“He only needs another war to become really
famous. I am quite positive our unfortunate acquisitions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
will let us in for another war before
long—the Chinese question—don’t you think so?
I think it so delightful that American women are
now beginning to take as much interest in politics
as English women do. You really have been
our superiors in that—as in many other—respects.
I heard you discussing the great questions of the
day with Mr. Nugent and Mr. Carlisle last night
and I quite envied you—I am just beginning, and
you seem to have learned politics with your alphabet.
I am <i>so</i> glad you have such influence with
Mr. Nugent, because I am convinced that he has
the making of a statesman in him and that it is
his duty to go into high politics. I have always
maintained,” she added weightily, “that it is a
man’s duty to cultivate his gifts. If he feels an
irresistible impulse to write he should do so—or
to paint—or to model. Politics are of equal importance
to the development of civilisation—the
right sort. Do not you agree with me, Lady
Helen?”</p>

<p>“I have always maintained that white is white,
and that the sun gives light when there are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
too many clouds,” I said, firmly. “How wonderfully
becoming those poppies are to you. I envy
any one who can wear red, it is a colour so full of
life, but it does not suit me at all.”</p>

<p>For a second she had looked puzzled, but she
is too thorough a woman of the world to hang
out her emotions, and she replied with her usual
suavity:</p>

<p>“If I could wear pink and dead white, and
brilliant blues as you can I should resign red without
a struggle. I have <i>never</i> seen anything so
beautiful as you are with a pink rose in your hair
and another at your throat.”</p>

<p>But I had had as much of this as I could stand
and I asked her abruptly if she had visited many
of the lakes.</p>

<p>“This is my first visit to the Adirondacks, I
am ashamed to say. I was taken abroad every
summer when I was a girl and I have gone almost
every year since from force of habit and because
I really have such a delicious time. It is one’s duty
to see all the beauties of the old world, don’t you
think so, Lady Helen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>But I did not want to talk about Europe. “I
hear that Spruce Lake is so beautiful,” I said.
“Could not we—a party of us—walk over there
some day? It is only seven miles, and Mr. Nugent
says the trail is very good.”</p>

<p>“Seven miles! <i>Dear</i> Lady Helen. Twice seven
are fourteen. Remember—we—alas!—are not
English.”</p>

<p>“They might put us up for the night——”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite impossible. We do not know any
of them. They are business people from Buffalo
and Utica and all those provincial towns.”</p>

<p>“In trade, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That is the way you would express it. It is
the same class—people who keep stores or make
things.”</p>

<p>“And they have the same tastes as yourself?”
I asked, puzzled at this new American facer.
“They are—sportsmen? They lead the same life
up here as you do?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know anything about them. I
suppose there are certain national characteristics;
several lakes in the Adirondacks are owned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
people of that sort. I am told that there was an
encampment of commercial travellers just off the
borders of this property last year.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand. Your lines of caste
are very marked, it has seemed to me. Why should
the leisure class and the commercial traveller have
the same tastes. It is very odd.”</p>

<p>But she refused to take the slightest interest in
the subject, and that afternoon as I was walking
to the lake of the water-lilies with Mr. N. I asked
him for enlightenment.</p>

<p>“Oh, Eastern men are keen sportsmen,” he said.
“That is to say, most—wherever there are mountains
and woods and lakes. It is an instinct inherited
from the old hunters and trappers—from the
days when the settlers shot game for food and
were as familiar with the wilderness as the farm.
These settlers were the ancestors of men who are
in all classes of life to-day. And you must remember
that there is no ‘Continent’ to run over to
for the yearly vacation. You can travel an immense
distance here and pay a good deal of money
only to hear a change of accent. But the forests of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
New York and Maine mean rest, reinvigoration,
and the complete happiness of the sportsman.
These men up here go in the woods every year as
naturally as they keep their nose to the grindstone
for the remaining ten or eleven months.</p>

<p>“And they are first-class sportsmen.”</p>

<p>“As good as any in England.”</p>

<p>“Men that—that—sell hats?”</p>

<p>“Carlisle is neither keener nor better.”</p>

<p>“Certainly your country is wonderfully interesting
and sometimes I feel as if I were groping
about in the neighbourhood of the true democracy.
Do they also play golf?”</p>

<p>“They do, indeed.”</p>

<p>“The tradesmen? People who keep retail
shops.”</p>

<p>“In the small interior towns many of them have
achieved sufficient prosperity and leisure, and
they are very keen about it. But in the large towns
it is usually the wealthier class that goes in for
it; the families of business and professional men,
successful on a large scale.”</p>

<p>And then I saw the lilies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>I must tell you that Mrs. Van Worden often
goes into the kitchen and sits in a rocking chair
by the window and talks to Mrs. Opp, and that
sometimes, when the men are out, she invites her
into the living-room. It appears that unless these
people were treated with a certain amount of consideration
they would not remain. A city servant
is a servant, but in the country they appear to
have studied the Declaration of Independence,
and doubtless they all know that Abraham Lincoln’s
sister “lived out.” Mrs. Opp is quite insensible
of her noble blood but she is as proud as
Lucifer all the same, and because her untainted
Americanism teaches her that she is “as good as
anybody.” She is willing to work for hire and
envies no one, but the slightest display of “airs,”
an unthinking snub, and she would pack her
bundle and march over the mountain with a
majesty the self-conscious American of high degree
never will achieve. It is truly delightful and I
love her. I often go out and sit in the rocker and
watch her great bulk move lightly about the exquisite
kitchen, and listen to her kindly drawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
emphasised by little gracious bends of the head.
She tells me the gossip of the mountains, and alluded
the other day to the cook at Boulder Lake
as “a lovely woman.” I told her about Jemima,
and she said:</p>

<p>“Poor child. I guess she was right, but she
didn’t know how to take it. Of course you folks
nat’rally wants ter eat with yourselves, and the
hired help as is used to farms and little country
towns don’t just see how it is at first. Different
people has different ways and all we ask up here
is to be treated right, we don’t expect the hull
earth. I’ve always knowed that, because I’ve lived
so much to hotels, but Jemima, I guess she’s pretty
green yet.”</p>

<p>When I told her about Jemima wanting to
see “a dook,” she laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’d like to see one, myself,”
she admitted, “not that I’d expect them to be so
different from other folks, but just because I’ve
read so much about ’em. That’s it. That’s it. I’m
glad he’s gittin’ on so nice. He had orter drink
plenty of milk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Curiously enough, that evening I received a
letter from Bertie saying that another “eminent
doctor” had put him on a milk diet and promised
him complete health in <i>one</i> year if he would be
faithful to it and the Adirondacks for that period.</p>

<p>“Its beastly uninteresting diet, Nell, and required
all the will I’ve got to make up my mind
to it,” he wrote; “but I want to get back to England
and be alive once more, so I’ve plunged in—literally
enough. I’ve leased an Inn on one of
the big public lakes from October till June, so
we’ll have a big old-fashioned house, they tell me,
and not a care, for the proprietor will ‘run it.’
Rogers has promised to come up twice a month
and I have written to Nugent and asked him to
come often and bring all the friends he likes. I
fancy from your letters that I should like the men—and
women—over there better than these—Rogers
excepted. I believe he is in love with
you, Nell, and so is Nugent; but you mustn’t
marry an American. By the way Roddy Spencer
is coming over here—wrote me to expect him
any day, and that he’d look me up at once. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
has just succeeded—old Landsburghe died last
month, and left Roddy all his personal property.
That must amount to three or four hundred
thousand and with the estates will set up Roddy
as well as he could wish—and his debts must
have been a pretty penny.”</p>

<p>I shall be rather glad to see Roddy. He was
always with Bertie when they were boys, but I
have not seen much of him of late years. Didn’t
he go to South Africa in the hope that Rhodes
would put him in the way of making a fortune—after
he had loaded himself too heavily with debts
to remain in London. I forget the details. The
legacy must have been a pleasant surprise, for
the old Marquis was very eccentric and had refused
to pay his debts. Well, I shall be glad to
see him and suppose he is as good looking as ever.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Chipmunk Lake</i>,<br>
August 11th</p>

<p><i>Dearest Polly</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;AM rather put out, and have been so irritable
for two days that I hardly know myself. Still,
thank heaven, nobody suspects it. I never
have been more amiable.</p>

<p>The other night a half dozen of the party were
playing Bridge in a corner of Mrs. Van Worden’s
living-room. I detest gambling and was trying
to interest myself in a book when I happened to
glance out of the window and saw—Mrs. Coward
and Mr. N. on their way down to the lake. Now,
I don’t pretend to be in love with the man, Polly,
but I do feel that while he is pretending devotion
to me it is little short of an insult for him to sneak
off with another woman—and an arrant coquette—for
a row at nine o’clock at night—it is scandalous
and I never have heard <i>any one</i> utter so many
virtuous platitudes as Mrs. C. If I thought he was
trying to make me jealous I should merely dismiss
him from my mind with the contempt he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
would deserve, but he really is incapable of such
pettiness, and I happen to know he was only too
frightened I’d find it out.</p>

<p>Polly, I cannot pretend to describe to you my
sensations when I saw those dark shapes steal
through the spruce grove before the house—the
branches are cut so high that it is really a grove
of slender trunks and you see the lake plainly.
For the moment I felt as if my heart were sinking
and I involuntarily pushed my hand underneath
it, while my breath shortened and my face
burned and then went cold. I had an impulse to
rush out and see if it really were true and to prevent
it. And then I fell into a rage. How I wished
Roddy Spencer were here. He is such a splendid
looking creature that he could be made to set
another man wild with jealousy. Suddenly I bethought
myself of Carlisle. He was playing, but
the game was nearly over. I made up my mind
in an instant; I got up and moved about the
room as if I were getting bored and impatient,
and in a few moments I caught his eye. I sent
him a glance of coquettish appeal, and it had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
desired effect. The moment the game was over
he was at my side and we ensconced ourselves on
the three-cornered divan under the swinging rose-coloured
lamp and never moved till twelve o’clock.
N. and Mrs. C. returned, looking half-frozen and
too silly, for they were obliged to get almost inside
the chimney. We never noticed them. I coquetted,
Polly, as I never coquetted before, and Mr. Carlisle
is a flirt whose accomplished depths it is interesting
to explore. For fear he should think I
was animated by pique—although he knew nothing
of the row—I contrived to intimate that I
was rather bored and on the verge of making an
excuse to return to Boulder Lake. At the same
time I made him feel what a triumph he would
achieve if he renewed the fascinations of Chipmunk
Lake for me. Nothing would induce me
to leave. I shall stay and prove to this self-satisfied
American flirt that I can make myself twice
as interesting as herself. I’ll employ her own weapon,
flattery, and make her platitudes apparent.
When I have sufficiently punished N. I’ll take
him back and keep Carlisle besides. I am sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
she wants to marry N. She has too large a fortune
of her own to be tempted by Carlisle’s, and N.’s
possibilities appeal to her inordinate ambition
and vanity.</p>

<p>This morning, of course, N. tried to be as devoted
as usual. But I dismissed him with an absent
smile, which became brilliantly personal the
moment C. appeared. We went off for a walk in
the forest and I never shall forget the expression
of N.’s face. I almost relented. But he deserves
punishment. I will have all or nothing. In the afternoon
Mrs. Coward drifted about majestically for
a half hour or so—her face expressing nothing—while
Carlisle and I read a novel together on the
divan in the corner. She tried to get N. into her
pocket but he merely glowered into the fire and
took no notice of her. Presently she drifted away,
and in the afternoon I saw her fishing with <i>Mr.
Van Worden</i>! If I were in such desperate straits I
would give out that I was writing a book, and keep
to my room. I fancy she wove a net of flattery for
Mr. Latimer, but he is a faithful soul. Mrs. Van
W. often looks sad, by the way, brilliant as her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
normal spirits are. It must be an unsatisfactory
roundabout way of trying to be happy. I am more
than ever determined to make no mistake when I
do marry, and to consider one thing only. I am
convinced there is no other happiness.</p>


<p class="right">13th</p>

<p>I have restored N. to favour but now give him
only half my time, that he never may be quite
sure of me again. Mr. C. apparently is quite as
high in my good graces, and while he is merely
stimulated and on the verge of becoming serious,
N. shows a curious mixture of alarm, anger and
energetic determination—and has taken no more
rows or walks with Mrs. C. I have managed to
convey to him that I will accept no divided homage,
and he is now only too eager to give me the
whole of it, and keeps out of Mrs. C.’s way. I
must say she is a thoroughbred. She has never betrayed
jealousy or pique by the flutter of an eyelash.
Perhaps I’ll restore Mr. Carlisle to her presently,
for I am rather tired of him. There is none
of the quality of the unexpected about him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
is a well-proportioned mass of good points and
good fortune—all trained outward; he never has
had the necessity—I believe his family has had
wealth and position for four generations—nor the
inclination to look very far into himself, consequently
the crust has deepened and the personality
diminished. Mr. N., on the other hand, while as
well-born, has had all his faculties sharpened by
a struggle with the impinging forces that array
themselves against the young man seeking to conquer
them without money. But first of all he received
a college education and distinguished himself
by his talents and hard study. Given the
illuminating education first and the struggle of
the wits for mastery afterward, and adding to both
the advantages and the principles of a gentleman—and
the inner life, the soul, of such a clever
man could not fail to be developed, complex and
interesting. I have had only glimpses of it, but it
has excited my curiosity so that I naturally could
not watch another woman carry him off with
equanimity. But I don’t think there is any danger
of another lapse. He has renewed his efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
to interest me, and—it certainly <i>is</i> clever of him—has
not so much as addressed me with his
eyes again. That is to say there is no appeal
in them. But there are other things, Polly, and
there is something about the man that fearfully
suggests the impossibility of failure. But the
weather is so heavenly just now that I wish everybody
in the world could have everything he
wanted. It is like living in a crystal dome and being
bathed by invisible waves of soft stimulating
perfumed air; with splendid masses of rich and
tender greens, of amber-browns and turquoise blue,
and the golden glory of sunsets for the eye, and a
vast uplifting silence. It is a sort of voluptuous
heaven, virtuously seductive.</p>

<p>The other day several of us walked down the
mountain to one of the farms to see the haying.
It was a grand valley among the mountain-tops.
From the farm we visited we looked over rolling
wooded hills, dotted with houses, cattle, and a
solitary white church spire, to a great irregular
chain of green mountains, encircling the horizon;
other peaks, faint and blue and distant, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
beyond their depressions; and the forest, the forest,
everywhere beyond the clearings of the farmers.</p>

<p>The hay had been cut and the mechanical rake
was gathering it into heaps when we arrived,
while men pitched it into a wagon where another
man stood with a pitchfork pressing it down. The
sweetness of that air! I never shall forget it; I was
doubly glad I never had used perfumes. It was
drenched with the sweetness of newly mown hay
and it almost intoxicated me. I fancy that if Mr.
N. had seized the occasion to press his suit—however,
I do not know. He did not, and as there
were some ten people in the field it would not
have been so romantic, in spite of the fragrance.
They gave me a hand-rake and I raked quite a
good deal of the pretty green stuff that it seems
shocking the farm-yard cattle should eat.</p>

<p>I was very much disappointed in the appearance
of these mountain farmers. How few things
in life resemble the traditions of them—we have
been so victimized by poets and romanticists. I
expected great brawny muscular fellows, with
enormous legs, brown skins, and deep chests. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
they are pale and thin and stooping, not one
looks as if he would see sixty or as if he got the
least pleasure out of life. Mr. N. explained that
hard work while they were young and no cessation
of it thereafter had broken their constitutions.
In winter they work on the roads which they are
under contract to keep open, and of course it
snows and freezes heavily and frequently. During
these same severe months they also go in the
woods and help to “draw” the logs the lumbermen
have cut during the summer for the pulp
mills. These logs have to be piled on sleds and
drawn to the creek, to be floated down to the
valley after the spring rains. The men rise at three
in the morning, working by torches till sunrise,
and seldom get to bed before eleven at night!
No wonder they are old men at forty. And I
don’t pretend to say how many cords of wood
they cut a year, or how many stone fences they
have built, or how many thousand stones they
dug from the ground before they could farm.</p>

<p>When all the hay had been removed the field
looked like a great green lawn—brilliantly green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
under the five o’clock sun. Beyond was a dip,
then the thick masses of the dark green woods,
touched into richer green by that blaze of sunshine,
then the mountains, sombre and faintly
blue. It is a beautiful land, Polly, but it depresses
me to think that while it means new blood and
new life and all cure for the outsider of leisure, it
sucks jealously back into its own store of vitality
the little store of its struggling children. It is
an unnatural and snobbish mother, after all.</p>

<p>Mr. N. calls me “Maud Muller,” since I raked
the hay. Did you ever come across that Quaker
poet, Whittier? He lived here in America, but
I am told he is the poet of the English quakers
as well. Mr. N. recited “Maud Muller” to me,
as we stood apart in the field—after I had tired
of raking. It really is a beautiful and musical
poem, but I could not see anything quakerish
about it.</p>

<p>When I write “I am told,” Polly, you may
assume that my authority is Mr. N. As far as my
limited comprehension can perceive he knows
everything.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>16th</p>

<p>Mr. Carlisle was called suddenly to Newport
last night by the illness of his mother. A man
rode thirty miles with the telegram, left his horse
at a farm house and walked the trail—which is so
full of rocks logs and mud-holes that no strange
horse could cover it without breaking a leg, and,
likely as not, his neck. It was just after dinner
and we were all grouped in the little spruce grove
before the camps watching the sunset, when the
man, looking so hot and tired, came hurrying out
of the woods. I am sure every one of us had a
fright when we saw the yellow envelope, a telegram
is such a rare interloper in the peace of
these mountain camps; and when the man said
“Mr. Carlisle,” I am equally sure that every one
of us wanted to hold Mr. C.’s hand. He went
rather pale, but said it was doubtless a false alarm
as his mother had been very nervous ever since
the war—during which her nerves had been on
the rack between apprehension of Cervera’s fleet
and his own demise—and hastened away to get
his things together. The keeper was sent out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
bring a buckboard in and Mr. C. left at three this
morning.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say, Polly, that before he left I
had rather a painful interview with him. I tried
to avoid it, but these American men are very
determined, my dear, and he managed to detain
me on the veranda after the others had gone in.
How I hate men to be serious! It hurts my conscience
so that I don’t get over it for weeks. I
had not the slightest intention of making him love
me, I only wanted to punish that woman for her
contemptible conduct in regard to Mr. N. Now
I feel quite as bad myself and wish that I had
simply contented myself with showing her that I
had a string tied to Mr. N. Mr. C. is really a fine
manly fellow and I felt like petting him as I
would Bertie and telling him not to mind, but of
course I couldn’t. He vows he’ll come back the
moment he is free, and gently insinuated contempt
for a suitor who was ten years too old to
win me. How funny these men are! What I am
to do with them all I am sure I cannot imagine,
but I would rather he went away hoping, and accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
his fate by degrees; for heaven knows I do
not wish to add too heavily to his troubles. Not
that I gave him any encouragement. Heaven forbid.
But they are so determined, these Americans.</p>

<p>The buckboard awoke me at three o’clock,
and I got up and peered out of my high window.
The woods looked so grey and ghostly, filled
with mist that was like a wet cobweb. The keeper
was driving and Mr. C. sat on the back seat
muffled in a winter great coat. Mr. Latimer went
out with him to the end of the trail; and presently
they disappeared into the forest and the
mist; and the silence was as if the world were dead.</p>

<p>But I have not told you of the new arrival.
She has come to spend the last of our camping
days here with Mrs. Wilbur Garrison, and she
is quite the most imposing, nay, overwhelming
person I have met in this extraordinary jumble of
democracy and caste, known—infelicitously, I
gather—as the United States. She is Mrs. Earle
wife of —— —— —— ——,<a id="FNanchor_4k" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and of course, a
personage of vast importance in Washington. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
she is no mushroom; she has belonged for heaven
knows how many generations—eight, perhaps—to
the haute noblesse of the country and was born
into an equally imposing number of dollars. But,
Oh, Polly! she is so cold, so haughty, so frozen!
Her handsome little head is set so far back on
her mountainous body, her backbone is so rigid
and her upper lip so proudly curled, there is such
a touch of icy peremptoriness in her manner, as
if it were her daily task to dismiss pushing aspirants
for social recognition—that I feel I have
looked upon the walking embodiment of the
aristocratic idea as it is interpreted by Americans.
Heaven knows she has been sweet to me, she has
even invited me to spend a month with her in
Washington next winter; but I know that after a
consecutive month of that chill presence I should
return to Bertie a sort of hysterical iceberg, my
marrow frozen and my humour on the verge of
insanity. And, although not in the least clever,
she would be quite an agreeable woman were it
not for her tragic self-consciousness, for she must
know the world of Washington like a book; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
it is a book I should like to read. But she will
not talk. All she has said of Washington is to intimate
her scorn of all “new-comers,” her boundless
<i>ennui</i> of the duties of her official position,
her sacrifice of her own inherited desire for segregation
from the common herd to the interests
of her distinguished husband. And yet she is not
ill-natured. She is as placid as Chipmunk Lake,
and, I am told, an exemplary wife and mother,
if <i>not</i> a radiant and fascinating hostess. Her only
fault is—well—her aristocracy! I tried to interest
her in the vivid people of Boulder Lake, in the
farmers of the valley, in Jemima, in the various
strange beings I have met in this strange country.
All by way of experiment, and in vain. Her mind
could not respond to the fact of their existence.
They had not been born in her original circle nor
thrust upon her by the exigencies of public life.
She betrayed a flicker of interest in Mrs. Opp and
remarked vaguely that she should have imagined
blood would count for more than that, then curled
her lip and relapsed into silence. Polly, what are
<i>we</i>? I am oppressed sometimes with the suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
that those countries which are not the United
States are like diseases in the creed of the Christian
Scientists—they do not exist. We merely imagine
we are, they know we are not, but tolerate
our whim. We have lost caste because we have
lost our consciousness of birth, and are therefore degenerate.
Upon my word, Polly, I begin to think
that the snobs who run after us in England are
the truest Republicans, after all. However, I have
nothing to say against my other friends of Chipmunk
Lake—always excepting Mrs. Coward—for
they are wholly charming, and unaffected, and not
afraid to let you see they know the world. Miss
Page does not, and thinks well of all the world—happy,
happy girl.</p>

<p>There is another point on which these people
greatly differ from those of Boulder Lake—that
is a certain homogeneity. Men and women, they
are like one large family and evidently have been
brought up together; and Mrs. Van Worden
says that with most of her set it is quite the
same. They all call each other by their first
names, and there is that same utter absence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
formality as with us when we are quite among
ourselves. In the set at Boulder Lake there is a
formality that never relaxes, they all seem to have
an abnormal respect for each other, and I vow I
never heard the first name of one of them. They
have accumulated each and all with care, but
their set is stamped with the heterogeneity of a
new incident in civilisation. And they have a
bourgeois timidity about expressing their real
opinion—if they have any—against the ruling
opinion—or fad. Each thinks as the other thinks—how
often I have disconcerted them!</p>

<p>Mrs. Coward, by the way, preserves her unruffled
demeanour and has never so much as put
out a little claw and scratched me. A woman of
twenty-seven with that amount of self-control
should be capable of great things. She never has
overdone it, never for a moment. (I wonder if
she has anything up her sleeve.)</p>

<p>I did not tell you, she informed me the other day
that she is a “Colonial Dame,” and <i>has her family tree</i>—with
two Presidents and ten statesmen on collateral
twigs—<i>framed and hung in her library at Newport</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Polly, what <i>do</i> you make of that. I ventured to
speak to Mrs. Van Worden about it, and she said:</p>

<p>“Rot. Fads. We all think that the Almighty
made Heaven first and the United States just
after—pickling it till Europe and Asia were old
enough to appreciate—but some of us have the
decency to do less talking than thinking. Nettie
Coward is fairly mum as a rule, but she can’t help
showing off to you—wants to impress you with
the fact that you’ve not got a monopoly on all the
blood there is. She’s a clever woman, but everybody
makes an ass of himself one way or another.
When we’ve got twenty generations to the good
we’ll be just as unconscious about it as you are.
But aristocracy will be a sort of itch with us till
then. Quantities of idiots have their family trees
framed.”</p>

<p>I find her very refreshing, Polly.</p>

<p>I have not written much about Mr. N. lately.
But I’ve talked with him!—hours and hours and
hours. It is no use trying to avoid him—and he
certainly is interesting. Well—heaven knows.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Helen.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>9. <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Your letter has just come. It seems
years since I last heard from you. I know how you
feel but I can’t help being glad that he has gone.
Nothing will happen to him. Don’t be foolish. He
is your manifest destiny and you will be married
to him this time next year. If Freddy really has
hurt himself and is suffering I can’t help feeling
sorry for the wicked little beast—I have grown so
soft about such things in the last two years. But
the circumstances were disgraceful and you were
wise to treat his summons to his bedside as a trick
to compromise you and hamper the proceedings.
What an enigma even a miserable little degenerate
can be. Who can say whether he really is
fascinated by you still—he is incapable of love—and
honestly desires a reconciliation, or whether
he wants to prevent your marriage with V. R.—or,
who knows?—perhaps he is afraid that woman
will want to marry him. Well, I do wish that the
evidence could have been gathered more quickly
and that it were over.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Chipmunk Lake</i>,<br>
August 19th</p>

<p><i>Dearest Polly</i>:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is eleven o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and I have been in
bed and asleep since half-after seven. I foresee
myself wide-awake for two hours and giving
you an account of the last two days. How flat that
sounds—but wait! And otherwise you might
never hear of them, for I return to Boulder Lake
to-morrow, and in this country events are so quickly
crowded into the past.</p>

<p>I wrote you—did I not?—that the subject of
a camping expedition had been mooted more than
once, but put off from time to time on account
of threatening weather and various other causes. I
longed to go; “camping out” in the “Adirondack
wilderness” being pitched upon a most adventurous
and romantic note; and finally I begged
Mr. Nugent to arrange it. He went “straight at
it” in the energetic American way, and in two
hours it was all arranged: Opp drove out in the
buckboard for another guide, and Mrs. Opp was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
making so many good things at once that all the
other cooks had to come over to help her. Then
Mr. Nugent and Mr. Van Worden packed the
big pack-baskets, and everybody was ready to
start at nine o’clock the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>The original plan was that all of us should go,
but the actual party were Mr. and Mrs. Meredith
Jones, Miss Page, Myself, Mr. Nugent, Mr. Latimer,
and Mr. Van Worden. The others “backed
out” on one excuse or another, and happy it was
for them and us that they did.</p>

<p>This colony is only two years old, and, as it
happened, none of the men ever had camped out
in this part of the Adirondacks before, and as they
found their lake and surroundings quite sufficient
there was not a tent on the place. However—and
the expedition was avowedly got up for my benefit—I
insisted that I wanted a genuine rough
camping experience, and we all took Opp’s word
for it that he knew the very spot—where there
was fishing, a clearing, and an “open camp,”
erected by other wood-loving spirits. It is true
he grinned as he assured me that I would get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
a good taste of the “genuine article,” but I suspected
nothing. What imagination, indeed, would
be equal to it!</p>

<p>Mrs. Coward kissed me good-bye quite affectionately,
for she expected to “go out” before I
returned, and even Mrs. Earle stood on the
shore in the little spruce grove and waved her
handkerchief with the others as we rowed down
the lake.</p>

<p>It was one of those crystal mornings when life
seems the divine thing of those imaginings of
ours when we have lost for a little the links that
hold them to facts. I never felt happier, I was
almost excited. It seemed such a delightful thing
to float off into the unknown like that, to go in
search of adventures, with the certainty that six
strong men, one of them your devoted slave,
would take the best of care of you. It was all so
undiscovered—that rough mountain world beyond
the lake—so unimaginable—well, I know
all about it now.</p>

<p>We were a very picturesque party, my dear.
The men wore white sweaters, corduroy breeches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and top boots. I wore hunter’s green, a short
skirt of covert cloth just above my boot tops, a
linen blouse the same shade and a little bolero
to protect my back and arms from the mosquitoes.
Miss Page, who is very dark, wore a bright red
skirt and cap and a red and white striped “shirt
waist” with a red tie. Mr. Nugent said she looked
exactly like a “stick of peppermint candy,” and
I am sure I shall recognise that indigestible the
first time I enter a “candy store.” Mrs. Meredith
Jones, who has golden hair and blue eyes, wore a
dark blue skirt and cap and the inevitable “shirt
waist”; but hers was striped with blue; and the
jauntiest little cape hung from her shoulders. Of
course we all wore canvas leggins as a further
protection from the mosquitoes, which are the
least of Adirondack charms.</p>

<p>Well, the moment we stepped on shore our
troubles began. We were landed on to a big slippery
stone, then handed across several others and
a few rotten logs into a swamp. Before us was an
impenetrable thicket as high as our heads and wet
with dew. We stood staring at it until the guides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
had shouldered their packs and picked their way
over rocks and logs to take the lead.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Opp, “there ain’t bin
any one in here for two years and the road’s growed
over, but it’ll be all right in about a mile. Good
trail then. We’ll go first and break the road.
Wimmin folks’d better bring up in the rear.”</p>

<p>So we started; crashing through the wet bushes
over the wetter ground until we came to a narrow
rocky trail sidling along the inlet. This is a gentle
stream in a wild setting. Its rocks are so many and
so big that the wonder is the water can crawl over
them, and the mountain beside the path is as precipitous
as a cliff. None of us paid much attention
to the beauties of Nature; we did not dare take
our eyes off the path, which had given way in
places and was swampy in others. Where it was
safe it was rocky. Nor could the men help us
much; the trail was too narrow. Single file was a
necessity, but Mr. Nugent was just behind me and
gave me occasional directions, besides surrounding
me, as usual, with an atmosphere of protection. So,
slipping, and bending and clutching at trees, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
picked our way along until at last the trail turned
up hill, and if no less rough was free of the worst
element of danger. In another half hour we had
passed a lumber camp and were on a level trail
along the crest of the mountain. The forest was
more open here, so much “lumbering” had been
done, but only the spruce were gone—not all of
those—and high on one side and down in a valley
on the other was the beautiful leafy forest,
full of the resinous odor of spruce gum, the
spaces rather a welcome change after the forest
densities of the last two months. And our procession
was very picturesque. The guides with their
big pack-baskets strapped to their shoulders were
in the lead, almost trotting, that they might outdistance
us and have an occasional rest. All our
men carried small packs and strode along looking
very supple and free, with the exception of poor
Mr. Van Worden who is rather stout and must
have felt the irksomeness of his pack. But he was
enjoying himself, no doubt of that; and indeed,
so were we all. Mr. Latimer, who had looked a
little conscience-stricken as he said good-bye to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Mrs. Van Worden, whistled as gaily as a school-boy
on a runaway lark. And it was so cool and
fresh in the woods, who wouldn’t be happy? Not
that there was one minute of easy walking—nor
an opportunity for sentiment. When we followed
the narrow trail through the brush we had to stoop
and overlook every inch before we put a foot
down. When we were on the long stretches of
corduroy, built by the lumbermen to haul their
logs over, Mr. Nugent held my hand, but he
might have been his ghost for all the impression
he made on me, so many were the holes and so
rotten some of the logs. Conversation was impossible.
We exchanged an occasional remark, but
we were all too intent on avoiding sprained ankles
and broken tendons—you cannot imagine
the painfulness of walking too long on log roads—to
be interested in any one but ourselves.</p>

<p>There were four hours of this, and good a walker
as I am I was beginning to feel tired, when
Opp, who had gone for ahead, came in sight
again, looking sheepish, rather.</p>

<p>“Be gosh!” he remarked to Mr. Van Worden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
as we met, “here’s a fine lay out. One of the camps
is burned. Them last campers done it, I reckon.
I seen ’em go round by way of Spruce Lake.”</p>

<p>I heard Mr. Van Worden swear softly under
his breath, and saw an expression of blank dismay
on Mr. Nugent’s face. Mr. Latimer burst
into a peal of boyish laughter. But Mr. Meredith
Jones said sharply,</p>

<p>“Well let’s go on and cook dinner. That is
all that concerns us now. We can decide what to
do later.”</p>

<p>“Are we there?” I asked, hopefully, for I
longed to give my poor bruised feet a rest.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Opp, “we’re there, all right.”</p>

<p>And in a moment, Polly, we “were there.”</p>

<p>Have you wasted any time, my dear, imagining
what an “open camp” is like? I hope not,
for it were a waste of good mental energy. The
briefest description will fit it. Three sides and a
sloping roof, all of bark. The front “open” in
the exactest interpretation of the word. Inside—nothing.
Twelve feet long and not quite the
depth of Mr. Meredith Jones, who is six feet two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>This mansion stood on the edge of a clearing,
across which lay a big felled tree. Against this we
immediately all sat down in a row. Beyond was a
charred ruin and near the log a rude table. Does
that sound romantic? I wish you could have seen
it. But we all laughed and were happy, and we
women, even then, did not realise the true inwardness
of the situation. The forest, the beautiful
forest, rose on three sides of us; beyond a
stream, concealed by alders, was a high sharp
ridge of mountains; and we were hungry.</p>

<p>The guides immediately set about making a
fire. There seemed to be plenty of logs and they
soon had a roaring blaze. Opp found a limb with
a forked top, which he drove into the ground just
beyond the fire and in the fork transfixed a long
curving branch which held a pail of water above
the flames. Mr. Nugent and Mr. Van Worden
unpacked the baskets, Mr. Meredith Jones set
the table, and Mr. Latimer fought off the hornets
which swarmed at the first breath of jam and
ginger-nuts. When we finally sat about that
board, on logs or “any old thing,” we eat that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
excellent luncheon of fried ham and hard boiled
eggs, mutton cutlets and fried potatoes, hot chocolate
and cake, with a grateful appetite, I can assure
you. Mr. Van Worden fried the ham and
potatoes and made the chocolate, and we all coddled
his culinary pride. All my fatigue vanished,
and Mrs. Meredith Jones looked equally fresh
and seemed prepared to take whatever might
come, with the philosophy of the other sex. But
poor Miss Page looked rather knocked up. She
has never gone in for walking and her very cap
had a dejected air; her fine colour was almost
gone, but she looked very pretty and pathetic
and all the men attempted to console her.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind it,” she said with a sigh, “if
we didn’t have to go back.” Then, as if fearing to
dampen our spirits with the prospect of carrying
her out, she added hopefully, “But it’ll be two
days hence. I reckon I’ll be all right by that time.
I’ll just lie about and rest.”</p>

<p>When luncheon was over Mr. Latimer made
her a comfortable couch of shawls, with a small
pack-basket for pillow, and she soon fell asleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
The guides washed the dishes, then immediately
felled two young spruce-trees, and, with the help
of Latimer and Mr. Meredith Jones, shaved off
the branches and covered the floor of the cabin.
This was our bed, my dear, and it was about a
foot deep. When it was finished they covered it
with carriage robes, and all preparations for nightly
comforts were complete. By this time it had
dawned on Mrs. Meredith Jones and myself that
we were <i>all</i> going to sleep under that roof. Opp
had examined the sky and predicted rain before
morning, and Miss Page was not equal to a return
journey—“doubling the road,” as they say
here—even if any of us had contemplated such a
thing.</p>

<p>“Tom and I will sleep in the middle,” said
Mrs. Meredith Jones reassuringly to me, after
an earnest conversation apart with her husband,
but I was immensely amused at the whole situation.
We were as helpless against certain circumstances
as if we did not possess sixpence
between us; for it would have taken nearly a
day to build another camp and the guides were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
too tired to think of such a thing. We were all
stranded out in space, and there was nothing to
do but make the best of it.</p>

<p>About two hours after luncheon I felt as if I
had had no exercise that day and Opp suggested
that I go up the mountain to see a gorge locally
famous. So, accompanied by Mr. N. and Latimer,
I followed him up the steepest and roughest
mountain of my experience. There was no trail.
He trampled ahead through the brush and we followed.
Mr. Nugent preceded and literally pulled
me up more than one perpendicular place, but
Opp insisted upon taking charge of me through
the slippery intricacies of a rocky stream. But we
were rewarded by the most beautiful spot I have
yet seen. Imagine a forest glade with five or six
<i>islands</i> of rock—boulders so huge that no other
word will describe them. These islands were
covered on all sides with the richest moss and the
most delicate ferns, and on the top of each grew
great trees, their long roots gripping the sides of
the rock like petrified pythons. Then a water-course
choked with smaller boulders, and rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
out of it, straight up for five hundred feet, a solid
wall of rock crowned with a pine forest. The wall
was a half-mile long and so smooth that one could
well imagine some terrible convulsion of these
Adirondacks during which a mountain had been
split in twain, one side grinding itself into these
boulder-islands of the forest. On high the tree-tops
were so matted that the glade was filled with
a twilight almost green. One had the impression
of walking under the sea. Each of us selected a
dry rock, and we sat there for an hour telling
mountain experiences. I had had one or two in
the Alps, extremely modest ones, but all the men
looked at me with intense admiration as I related
them. American men seem to have an almost
passionate admiration for women of great physical
endurance and courage. Our men take it as a
matter of course. Mr. Nugent thought it the most
charming thing in the world that I should want
“more exercise” after the heavy tramp of the
morning. He said one rather clever thing, by the
way. The others, after a time, wandered down to
the foot of the palisade in search of the ice caves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
and as I rather feared that Mr. N., under the influence
of the wild beauty about us, might lose a
self-control which is plainly manufactured and
maintained through a fear of losing everything,
(I dread and almost long for the time when it will
give way altogether) I turned the conversation to
politics and asked him if he looked forward to the
possible Bryan administration with the great apprehension
that other Republicans seemed to feel.</p>

<p>“No; I can’t say I do,” he said. “Nothing is
ever as bad in politics as the anticipations; anticipations
are the exaggerations of much talk. Besides—it
is quite on the cards that Bryan will be
an arrant snob before he has been a month in the
White House. Likely as not, his first taste of
Society will induce conservatism. When he has
sat at table a few times with titled Ambassadors
he will hasten to forget the ridiculous little farm
he bought to have his pictures taken in. Then, the
only thing left for us to do is to marry his daughter
to a gentleman and persuade him to send his
son to Harvard. His reform will be accomplished
in less than a year. There is no snob so complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
as a democrat reformed by the right sort of visiting
cards. Of course a small nucleus, the old set of
Washington, will not go near the White House,
and as soon as the Bryans discover that diplomats,
senators, cabinet officers and army people are
not all the cream of high society they will become
downright aristocrats; and when the shirt-sleeved
voter from Lincoln, Nebraska, calls, will
conceal their ennui and irritation indifferently
well. That means alienation of the sons of the
soil, and no second term for Bryan. If Washington
is wise it will do its best to make a fool of
him.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t much faith in Mr. Bryan’s much
vaunted sincerity,” I said with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a particle,” he said contemptuously.
“He has his picture taken too often.”</p>

<p>The others returned at this juncture and we set
out upon the difficulties of our homeward journey.
But never mind, it was all very delightful and I
never shall forget the beauty of that rocky glade.</p>

<p>When we returned to the camp, we found Mrs.
Meredith Jones asleep and Miss Page keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
watch. The men had all gone fishing and Mr.
Nugent and Mr. Latimer hastened to join them.
Miss Page looked refreshed but turned to me a
perturbed face.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe it is possible that we are all
going to sleep in there,” she said. “Why, it is
shocking! I begged Mr. Van Worden to put up
a partition, but he says it is quite impossible, that
there won’t be room to turn over, as it is. I wish I
hadn’t come. Suppose it should get out? Why,
people would be horrified.”</p>

<p>“Really,” I said, “I think you take an exaggerated
view. We are all going to bed with our
clothes on, the camp is open, there are nine of us,
and our chaperons will sleep in the middle. We
may not be comfortable but I think the proprieties
will take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>“I think it is shocking,” she said, “perfectly
shocking. It seems so coarse and horrid. I’ll remember
it as long as I live.”</p>

<p>I felt like shaking her, but she looked so distressed
that I said soothingly: “Please don’t
worry. I will sleep next to Mrs. Meredith Jones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and you can tuck away in the corner where no
one can see you and you will be quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied quickly, “I insist upon having
the corner—particularly as you don’t mind,”
she added apologetically. “You are quite different
from my idea of English girls. I should have
thought that you would be simply horrified.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we are more matter-of-fact than you
are,” I said drily. “Where a thing can’t be helped
it can’t, and we are sensible about it. Now, I am
surprised at you. I had always supposed that
American girls——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” she exclaimed. “You are going
to judge us all by those horrid things you meet
in Europe and in novels. I can assure you that
Southern girls—<i>gentlewomen</i>—are as particular
as English girls—more so, I reckon. Do you realise
that we are going to sleep in the same room
with six men?”</p>

<p>“I don’t look at it in that way at all,” I said
tartly. “And for heaven’s sake make up your
mind to the inevitable and think no more about it.”</p>

<p>The men returned soon after with a basket full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
of trout and Mr. Van Worden fried them for supper.
I don’t think I ever eat anything quite so
good as those trout.</p>

<p>“He beats the cars, cookin’,” observed our
chief guide, and Mr. Van Worden looked as
pleased as if he had made a million in Wall
Street.</p>

<p>After supper the guides built a high fire of
great logs, and we all sat about and the men
“spun yarns” of the days when the panther and
the bear roamed the woods, and finished with
stories of the beautiful red deer that alone claims
the forest to-day. Of course the men smoked, and
we were all very happy and comfortable until we
went to bed. Mr. N. sat as close to me as he decently
could, and—I will confess to you, Polly—under
the encouragement of the shadows which
covered a part of me and all of him he held my
hand. I could not struggle—well——</p>

<p>About ten the men all marched up the hill in
single file, singing, and we had the camp to ourselves
for a half hour. We took off our boots,
corsets and blouses, put on dressing sacks, tied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
our heads up in silk handkerchiefs, and our night
toilet was complete. Miss Page had evidently
made up her mind to accept the situation, but she
was so manifestly uncomfortable that I tied nearly
all of her face up in her handkerchief and tucked
her away in the corner with the blanket up to her
nose. She turned her back upon us and regarded
the chinks of the bark wall in silent misery. Mr.
Van Worden had brought three extra pairs of
socks and these he had directed us to pull over
our stockings as the night would grow very
cold.</p>

<p>We had been in bed nearly twenty minutes
and had already learned something of its hardness
when the men returned.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Opp, “you must all lie on the
same side and when one of you wants to turn
over be sure to sing out and then we’ll all turn
over together.”</p>

<p>His was the only remark. The other men pulled
off their boots and crawled into bed without a
word, looking rather sheepish, and ostentatiously
refraining from glancing in our direction. Men are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
certainly more modest than women in certain conditions,
and Mrs. Meredith Jones and I almost
laughed out loud, especially as the other guide
went to bed with his hat on!</p>

<p>For about a half hour we were as quiet as the
sardines we must have looked. Then my side—the
one I was lying on—began to ache from my
neck to my heel, and from the numerous sighs
and restless jerks I inferred that we all were affected
in the same way. At all events Opp “sang
out,” “Heave over, hey?” and we all turned like
a well-regulated machine. I whispered to Miss
Page but she would not answer me.</p>

<p>It was just after that we became conscious that
the temperature was about ninety. The fire was
not three feet in front of us and blazing more
violently every moment. I had been endeavouring
to forget my discomfort in watching the black
masses of the tree-tops thrown by the blaze into
extraordinary relief against the dulled sky and
tarnished stars, when I heard Mr. Van Worden
whisper fiercely,</p>

<p>“What in heaven’s name did you build that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
red hot fire for? It’s hot enough for three camps
and we won’t sleep a wink.”</p>

<p>Opp replied apologetically: “I thought it was
goin’ to rain and it was best to have things well
het up, but I guess it haint. It’s hot and no mistake.”</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Latimer fighting to get out of an extra
sweater without attracting attention, and I, by
the same herculean efforts, managed to reach
down and get off my stockings and those socks.
But still the heat was insupportable and the bed
grew harder every moment. Our pillows, too,
were logs under the spruce, and I am used to a
baby pillow that I double under my neck and
face. How I longed for it!</p>

<p>Finally Latimer slipped out of bed and went
over to the edge of the clearing and lit his pipe.
The guides followed immediately, then Mr. Meredith
Jones, and they sat along the log in dejected
silence. Mrs. Meredith Jones heaved a deep sigh.
“I really can’t stand it, girls,” she whispered; and
followed her husband. Of course we went too, and
Mr. Van Worden was left alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>For a half hour we sat about in an almost complete
silence, waiting for that wretched fire to
burn down. Opp separated the logs, and finally,
as we were all too sleepy to hold our heads up, we
crawled back to bed, one by one, all except Mr.
Latimer, who stretched out on the table, and Mr.
Nugent who made a bed for himself on the
ground. That gave us a trifle more room in
the camp, and we could turn without “singing
out.” In a few minutes, hot as it still was, I fell
asleep.</p>

<p>I suppose it was two hours later that I awoke.
The fire had taken a fresh start and was blazing
more merrily than ever. I felt as if I were in a
Turkish bath, and as Miss Page was no longer
in front of me I inferred that she had been driven
forth again. Then it occurred to me that she
would not have budged without Mrs. Meredith
Jones, and I turned about quite suddenly. Mrs.
M. J. was not there! Nor Mr. M. J. Nor the
guides. Oh, Agatha! Agatha! I was alone in bed
with Mr. Van Worden.</p>

<p>The situation was humorous, but somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
embarrassing. I hardly knew whether to pretend
sleep or not, for I did not feel like going out and
sitting on that log again. I could see the dark figures
in various dejected attitudes. Mrs. M. J. and
Miss Page were sitting back to back with their
heads hanging, while Mr. M. J. stood with his
hands in his pockets glowering at the fire. Latimer
was sitting on the table smoking his pipe, and
Mr. N. was digging his heels viciously into the
earth. As for the guides they lay flat in the distance,
tired out, poor things. Only Mr. Van
Worden looked serene. He, too, lay on his back,
his hands clasped over the greater part of him.
I supposed he was asleep, but he remarked genially:</p>

<p>“Hot, isn’t it, Lady Helen? I’m afraid one
camping experience will do you for the rest of
your natural life.”</p>

<p>I assured him that I never had been so much
entertained, and we conversed as naturally as if it
had been noon-day until I was reminded of the
irregularities of the situation by a gasp from Miss
Page. She nudged Mrs. M. J., whispered hurriedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and in another moment I was chaperoned on either
side.</p>

<p>It was at least another hour before the fire
burned down and the temperature cooled. Then
the men crawled back to bed, one by one, and in
a few moments they were all sleeping—and as
quietly as kittens. It really was quite remarkable.</p>

<p>But one could not sleep long at a time on that
bed, and once I was glad to be awake. High up
on the highest tree of the mountain a hoot owl
broke the petrified stillness of that lonely forest.</p>

<p>“Too wit, too wit, too wooo!” he called loudly,
and then he added with impatient emphasis, “Too
wit, too wit, <i>too woo</i>,” as if to say, “Do you understand
that?” He was a bit of a scold, but he had
all the grey dome and all the forest depths to talk
into. No comrade answered him, and nothing ever
gave me such an impression of the solitude of a
mountain forest.</p>

<p>By six o’clock we had endured all that the human
frame is capable of in the way of sleeping
on hard and prickly spruce, and the men rose as
by one impulse and went down to the spring to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
wash. We dressed as hurriedly as possible, and,
I must say, looked surprisingly fresh. And the
morning was so deliciously cool, and Mr. Van
Worden’s coffee so fragrant and bracing, his trout
so crisp and Mrs. Opp’s “johnnie cake,” so excellent
that we sat about Mr. Latimer’s bed in the
highest spirits and congratulated each other that
we were “camping out.” Even Miss Page, having
weathered the worst of it, announced herself ready
to stay another night, and talked continually in her
pretty Southern brogue. She was looking like a
beautiful gypsy, too, and I think our one small
mirror had consoled her for many things. She
flashed her eyes about with the impartiality of the
kind-hearted coquette, and was quite the life of
the uncomfortable group about the table.</p>

<p>After breakfast Mrs. M. J., Latimer, Mr. Nugent
and myself, led by Opp, with an axe over his
shoulder, started off to see some famous falls. The
rest went fishing. As the trail along the “still-water”
had been choked by lumbermen, Opp had
to rely on his general knowledge of the land, and
every few minutes he “blazed” a tree, <i>i.e.</i>, hacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
off a piece of the bark with his axe, that there
should be no danger of going astray when we returned.
The ground was less broken up than usual
and we strode along in single file looking for all
the world like a party of pioneers penetrating the
wilderness. It was a jolly experience and I would
not have missed it for anything.</p>

<p>The falls were about two miles from the camp
and we were an hour reaching them, for Opp got
off the track several times. I can imagine that they
look very fine indeed when there is anything falling.
But all we saw was a sloping wall of solid
rock, about four hundred and fifty feet high and
a fifth of a mile wide, crowned with spruce. There
is a deep wide pool below, and a mass of rocks on
which we sat and tried to picture the mighty cascade
of other seasons. On one end—the perpendicular
end—of the wall there were soil and trees,
and Opp asked me if I would like to “climb the
falls and see the sights.” I was half way across the
rocks in a moment with Mr. N. and Latimer after
me, while Opp remained with Mrs. M. J.</p>

<p>It was a straight climb, my dear, of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
hundred and fifty feet. It hardly sloped once and
there was just one ledge of about six steps. We
had to pull ourselves up by trees and bushes, and
more that once Mr. N. dragged me up, while Mr.
L. pushed me. But altogether I did rather well,
and was quite rewarded by their enthusiastic approval.
But there was a better reward than that.
From an elevation above the falls we saw five
mountain ranges. They seemed to fill all space,
and the blue dome to press down its rim about
them, holding such a flood of crystal and gold!
There were many beautiful pines about us, sage
green with a delicate fairy-like quality in spite of
their greatness, and once more the undesecrated
forest, so dense that Mr. N. had noted every inch
of ground we traversed.</p>

<p>Of course it was worse going down than ascending
and I was glad to have two men to take
care of me.</p>

<p>Well, we spent all of that day very pleasantly,
and the night promised to be rather more comfortable,
for Mr. Nugent, Mr. Latimer, and the
guides all made beds for themselves under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
stars and the fire was left to go out after supper.
But, alas! about midnight it began to rain, they
all came crawling under shelter, and there was
little more sleep that night.</p>

<p>The rain stopped long enough for us to breakfast
comfortably, and then we held a consultation.
The plan had been to “stay out” three nights,
but we were all a little tired of it, and the skies
looked very forbidding.</p>

<p>“If you want my opinion,” remarked Opp, “I
say go, and be quick about it. It’s set in for all
day, and if we git back to the Lake without a
soakin’ we’ll be luckier’n I think we will.”</p>

<p>That settled it. We had no desire to sit on our
bed all day and then sleep on it another night.
The guides began to pack at once, and within an
hour we were on our way.</p>

<p>We had hardly started when it began to pour,
and it has not stopped yet. What a walk it was!
However we reached home without pneumonia
and broken ankles heaven only knows, but not
one of us has a cold; and although my feet feel
as if they had been pounded with a hammer they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
are quite whole. When we were not picking our
way over the narrow trail through the brush—dripping
and as high as our heads—we were on
those horrible corduroy roads, made so slippery
by the rain that every step was a danger. Once
I fell, and I twisted my foot three times and
wrenched myself up to my waist. My feet were
swimming in my boots and it was an effort to lift
them. I felt sorry for Miss Page, who is a pampered
creature, but she never uttered a complaint,
although she told me afterward that every time
we came to one of those interminable stretches of
corduroy she wanted to sit down and cry. She
certainly is a fine creature, with all her little
foibles.</p>

<p>When we got to the lumber camp we all sat
down in the rain and rested before climbing the
corduroy hill beyond. Mr. N. explained to me
the use of the curious objects piled under a
shed. They were huge boxes on runners with four
round holes in each end. When the snow is on the
ground, covering corduroy and rocks, these boxes
are filled with water and dragged by horses over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
the road to be used for drawing the lumber to the
streams. From the front holes the water spouts
continuously, and as it strikes the ground it
freezes, making a solid smooth surface over
which the log sledges can travel with ease. But
what a life! No wonder these mountaineers look
old; but Mr. N. told me that lumbermen become
so fascinated with the life that they cannot be
tempted into the valleys.</p>

<p>You can imagine the difficulties of that narrow
sidling swampy trail by the inlet. It was just twice
as bad as in dry weather, and I almost was discouraged
once or twice. Perhaps I should have
been, had it not been for a very reassuring and
helpful presence; but it was bad enough.</p>

<p>Latimer had hastened on to the lake to fire his
revolver, the signal that we were coming. When
the rest of us arrived the boats were almost there,
but as we were all hot and wet, and a cold wind
played upon us as we stood on the stones again,
it is a wonder we are not all wrecks. As soon as I
reached home Mrs. Van Worden made me drink
hot whiskey, while Mrs. Opp and Henriette undressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
and rubbed me down. I am none the worse
for wear, but felt quite done up by half-after seven
and went to bed. Hence this great letter. Good
night. I return to Boulder Lake to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Helen.</span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Boulder Lake</i><br>
August 20th<br>
10 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span></p>

<p>I forgot to give this letter to the postman to-night
so I will tell you of two or three surprises
which have made me wide-awake, rather.</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Nugent returned with me, (and
as there is always a room at the Club House at
his disposal I suppose he will remain through the
deer and grouse seasons—unless—but I vow I
don’t know!) I was glad to see that beautiful
avenue dividing the dark forest, once more, and
we walked slowly, the buckboard following. I
can’t say the familiar corduroy filled me with
sentimental emotions and my insteps ached at
the first glimpse of it; but I have that buoyancy
within that carries my feet over many a weary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
mile, and my companion, as ever, was very interesting.
I forget just what we talked about.</p>

<p>We were half way up the last hard bit of corduroy
and my eyes as usual were intent upon the
logs when Mr. N. said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Look!”</p>

<p>I stopped at once and followed the direction of
his glance. Before I had time to wonder if he had
seen a bear I saw, standing on the ledge above,
Mr. Rogers—and Bertie! The light was full upon
them and I saw in a flash that Bertie was stouter
and had lost his terrible pallor. He was not ruddy,
but he was brown, and there was colour in his
cheeks.</p>

<p>Polly, did you ever have a wild whirl of emotions
inside of you while you forced your exterior
to be as impassive as a shell? I wanted to give
one of the war-whoops with which they call to
one another up here, and I felt so much like
bursting into a storm of tears that I dared not
even speak.</p>

<p>When Bertie and I met we merely shook hands,
and he remarked that he was glad to see me back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
but I knew he wanted to hug me. Then I gave
my hand to Mr. Rogers—and was just in time to
see the look with which my two knights were
measuring each other.</p>

<p>I walked ahead with Bertie and he said that
between the air and the milk he certainly was
getting well, and I found my voice and told him
that I never had felt so happy in my life. But my
absorption in Bertie was divided for the moment
by a new surprise.</p>

<p>We had left the level stretch and were walking
down the incline to the boat landing (I had been
too interested to notice that we had not turned
off into the path leading to our camp), when I
stopped short with half a sentence forgotten.
Waiting at the pier was a gondola—a gondola
with silken curtains and cushions and an Italian
gondolier.</p>

<p>Bertie laughed gaily at my startled face, for in
truth I was afraid for the moment that something
in my brain had gone wrong.</p>

<p>“Rogers sent for it—to Chicago, of all places!”
he said. “It is a remnant of the World’s Fair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>And then I remembered I once had said to Mr.
Rogers that I could not understand why they did
not have gondolas on these beautiful lakes instead
of commonplace boats.</p>

<p>All my coquetry was enchanted and I turned
to Mr. Rogers with such a radiant face that he
must have felt a bit rewarded. While I was
thanking him—glad of that much outlet for my
excitement—and he was making one of his charming
speeches and looking so dignified and not the
least bit of an ass, I stole a glance at Mr. N. His
face wore a cynical grin that was almost sardonic.</p>

<p>Well, I gondolaed home and fell into Agatha’s
arms, then discovered Bertie’s welcome. He had—himself,
mind you—tacked that most beautiful
of shrubs, the ground pine, all over the walls of
the living-room. They looked a mass of soft green
and gold and the antlered heads of the deer
seemed to be set in their native woods. On the
table was a great bunch of crimson sweet peas—incomparably
more fragrant than ours—sent by
Jemima, and a bowl of water-lilies from Mrs.
Laurence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>After I had answered all of Agatha’s questions
and assured her that I was as well as ever—she
thinks I am thin, but how I have tramped!—Bertie
and I went out and gondolaed round the
lake. It was just five o’clock. The men were
going home from the tennis court, and waved
their hats at me and gave the unearthly wood
call.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, all the doors opened, and the
women in their bright muslin gowns flitted out
and waved their handkerchiefs to me. It was a
pretty sight and a graceful act. Of course, I landed
and they said a great many of their charming
things.</p>

<p>When I went home another surprise awaited
me—in my room. On the table was a box of splendid
roses and an elaborate basket of chocolates
tied with yards of my favourite bright blue ribbon.
Mr. Nugent’s card was attached. Of course he had
sent to New York for them.</p>

<p>I don’t think I ever went to bed feeling so
happy.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Helen.</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>21st</p>

<p>I suppose we have all taken note of that malignant
influence in the unseen world which makes
us unreasoningly and unguardedly happy just before
our stiffest blows. One would think these
bitter contrasts were purposely arranged to destroy
our power of philosophy.</p>

<p>It was at breakfast that I was confounded, more
nearly knocked over than I ever was in my life.</p>

<p>“By the way, Nell,” Bertie remarked casually,
“what a ripping fine woman Mrs. Coward is.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Coward?” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t mean to say you didn’t know she
was here?”</p>

<p>“I did not!” I could barely articulate. And a
perturbed glance from Agatha increased my consternation.
“When did she come?”</p>

<p>“Three or four days ago—Oh, yes, she said you
had left the same morning for your camping
tramp.”</p>

<p>“Whom is she visiting? I had no idea the
aristocracies would mix.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laurence. Don’t you like Mrs. Coward?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“I am glad she is visiting Mrs. Laurence. I
should say they would scratch each other’s eyes
out immediately.”</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed you don’t like her. I hoped
you’d have her in the house a lot. She’s a long
sight the most fascinating American I ever met—a
regular ripper, by gad!”</p>

<p>I don’t know how I controlled myself, but I
knew that if I said too much and suggested opposition
Bertie would be on his hind legs at once.</p>

<p>This was what she had up her sleeve, Polly.
What deceit, what treachery, what sneakingness.
Only a <i>widow</i> would be capable of such a thing.
But I must say I respect her. She fooled me completely.
I could not have been capable of so clever
a revenge, and I detest her for it, because she has
not the true sporting instinct, but she is to be
reckoned with all the same. In spite of her platitudes
and her ingenuous pride in the seven generations,
she is both clever and deep—when her
pride is in arms, and revenge and ambition both
spur her on to capture a duke.</p>

<p>But <i>will</i> she marry him? <i>Oh!</i> Many moths have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
fluttered about that flame. But she is so subtle.
And in addition to her indisputable magnetism
she has developed fascination into a fine art. Of
course she has scented out all Bertie’s weak points
and flattered them. I can hear her discoursing
about the solemn responsibilities of the hereditary
legislator, and that is what is haunting Bertie most
at present. Of course she knows all about Dad,
and her dulcet enthusiasms on that convenient
weakness—Oh, <i>dear</i>! Agatha says they have been
almost inseparable since the afternoon she arrived.
She did not lose a minute!</p>

<p>He actually asked me if he could take her out in
<i>my gondola</i>. I felt like telling him to take her out
and drown her, but I gave my consent as graciously
as I could, and came into the house to
think. I dare not go to the forest, for I know that
Mr. N. is lying in wait for me and I feel certain
that after this gondola declaration he will press
his suit; and when he <i>does</i> plant himself on both
feet in the middle of the trail and I on the wrong
side—Oh, heaven!</p>

<p>I induced Agatha to go over to the tennis court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
so that I could not receive Mr. Rogers if he called.
But for some time I could not even write to you,
I could only storm up and down the living-room
and try to think of some way to foil that woman
and deliver Bertie. Fancy having her for a sister-in-law!
And she would radiate a subtle triumph
till the day of her death. But the real—underlying—point
is that she is not the wife for Bertie.
He must marry an intelligent woman who will give
herself to him and his career, and this one would
be entirely wrapped in her own petty ambitions.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to me that Miss Page had
promised to spend the first two weeks of September
with me. She is still at Chipmunk Lake, for
the other women do not leave for two days yet.
The buckboard had not gone. I wrote her a note,
imploring her to come at once as I was bored and
lonely. Then I bribed the driver to take it to her
to-day, and he said he would wait and bring her
back. She is far more beautiful than Mrs. C., and
younger. She may not be so subtle but she has all
the fascination of a buoyant and unaffected coquette.
And she is worth six of Mrs. C. as regards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
character and sincerity. Not, alas! that that adds
to one’s power over man. But I am hoping that
Bertie will contrast her real brightness with Mrs.
C.’s platitudes, and discover that the widow is boring,
that he will succumb to Miss Page’s superior
beauty, and that propinquity will do its work. If
only it doesn’t all happen before she gets here! Mrs.
C. has had him in her pocket for three hours—<i>in
my gondola</i>. She has on a white frock and a scarlet
shawl and a red poppy in her hair. There is no
denying that she is hideously attractive. Oh, Polly,
how I wish you were here!</p>

<p>To add to my burdens Bertie gave me, this
morning—he mercifully forgot it last night—an
impassioned epistle from Mr. Carlisle. His mother
is better and he is returning to Chipmunk Lake
for the hunting season. He says he shall devote
three days a week to deer and the rest to me—that
if they won’t invite him to the Club House
he’ll camp on the next lake, which is only a mile
away and on State lands. But of course they’ll invite
him to the Club House. Oh, Polly! Do you
think any woman ever was in such a tangle before!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>On the whole I think I’ll go out into the forest
and talk to Mr. N. about it. I <i>must</i> talk to somebody
or I’ll have brain fever. And I’m used to
diverting his mind—“standing him off,” as they
say here. And I want sympathy.</p>

<p>This is really good-bye. I won’t write another
line till I am in a more cheerful state of mind—induced
by Miss Page’s triumph over the widow—for
I do not want to add to your worries.</p>
